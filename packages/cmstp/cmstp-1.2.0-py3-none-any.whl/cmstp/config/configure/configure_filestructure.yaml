# The structure under HOME will be placed into the user's home directory, and the
#     structure under ROOT will be placed into the root directory ("/") (requires '--root' arg to enable).
# The final values may be
# - null (indicating an empty directory/file to create)
#   (type (folder/file) is inferred from if a suffix is present (e.g. '.txt'))
# - (str) a github repository reference (indicating a repo to clone from)
#   (see see 'parse_git_ref' function in this repo for expected format)
# - (str) "path://<source>" (indicating local path to copy from)
# - (str) "link://<source>" (indicati a symlink to create)
# Path sources may include the $HOME environment variable, and should otherwise be absolute paths. Relative
#   paths will be considered relative to the host's current working directory, which is not ideal.
# Recommended: Add custom executable scripts and aliases in $HOME/.cmds, then add it to PATH
