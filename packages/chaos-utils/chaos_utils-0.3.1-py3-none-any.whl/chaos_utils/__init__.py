"""
chaos-utils: small collection of utility helpers used by ak1ra-lab.

This package contains utilities for working with dictionaries, text
and file encodings, gitignore-aware filesystem helpers, tar/zstd helpers
and small logging helpers.

The modules are intentionally lightweight and each documents its public
functions in their docstrings which can be used by automated documentation
generators.
