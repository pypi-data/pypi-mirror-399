            "elastic-like" datastore.

                This index name will be used for all queries and operations.
            client (AsyncOpenSearch | None, optional): Pre-configured OpenSearch client instance.
                If provided, it will be used instead of creating a new client from url/cloud_id.
                Must be an instance of AsyncOpenSearch. Defaults to None.
            url (str | None, optional): The URL of the OpenSearch server.

            api_key (str | None, optional): The API key for authentication.
