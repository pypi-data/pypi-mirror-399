            This attribute ensures users know they\'re using Elasticsearch, not a generic
            "elastic-like" datastore.

            index_name (str): The name of the Elasticsearch index to use for operations.
                This index name will be used for all queries and operations.
            client (AsyncElasticsearch | None, optional): Pre-configured Elasticsearch client instance.
                If provided, it will be used instead of creating a new client from url/cloud_id.
                Must be an instance of AsyncElasticsearch. Defaults to None.
            url (str | None, optional): The URL of the Elasticsearch server.
                For example, "http://localhost:9200". Either url or cloud_id must be provided

            api_key (str | None, optional): The API key for authentication.
                If provided, will be used for authentication. Mutually exclusive with username/password.
                Defaults to None.
            username (str | None, optional): The username for basic authentication.
