## System Metrics

1. Get current system metrics:
   - Use get_metrics resource for {host}
   - This provides CPU, memory, disk usage, and load average

2. Check for high resource usage:
   ```
   execute_command(host="{host}", command="top -bn1 | head -20")
   ```

3. Check disk space on all mounts:
   ```
   execute_command(host="{host}", command="df -h")
   ```

4. Check memory details:
   ```
   execute_command(host="{host}", command="free -m")
   ```

5. Check system load:
   ```
   execute_command(host="{host}", command="uptime")
   ```
{logs_section}{services_section}
## Network Health

Check network connectivity:
```
execute_command(host="{host}", command="netstat -tuln | head -20")
```

Check established connections:
```
execute_command(host="{host}", command="netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l")
```

## Recent System Events

Check dmesg for hardware/kernel issues:
```
execute_command(host="{host}", command="dmesg | tail -20")
```

Check authentication logs:
```
execute_command(host="{host}", command="tail -20 /var/log/auth.log")
```

## Health Report Summary

After running the above checks, summarize:

1. **System Resources**:
   - CPU usage: [X]%
   - Memory usage: [X]%
   - Disk usage: [X]%
   - Load average: [X]

2. **Services Status**:
   - List all checked services and their status

3. **Issues Found**:
   - List any errors from logs
   - List any services that are not running
   - List any resource usage concerns

4. **Recommendations**:
   - Based on findings, provide action items

## Thresholds to Watch
- CPU > 80%: High usage warning
- Memory > 85%: Memory pressure warning
- Disk > 90%: Disk space critical
- Load average > number of cores: System overloaded
