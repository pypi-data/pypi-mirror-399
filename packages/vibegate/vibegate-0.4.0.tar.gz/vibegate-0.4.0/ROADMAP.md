# VibeGate Roadmap

## Current Focus (v0.3)

**Friendly by default, powerful when needed.**

- ✅ Plain English reports for normal humans
- ✅ Technical depth on demand (`--detail deep`)
- ✅ Local LLM helpers (Ollama, OpenAI-compatible)
- ✅ Agent prompt packs for AI coding assistants
- ✅ Web UI (static viewer)
- ✅ Evolution pipeline (label → tune → propose)

## Near Term (v0.4 - Q1 2025)

**Enhanced checks + framework intelligence:**

- More defensive programming rules
- Better finding categorization (by impact, not just type)
- Framework-specific rulesets (FastAPI, Django, Flask)
- Improved AST analysis (better control flow understanding)
- Performance optimizations (parallel check execution)

## Medium Term (v0.5 - Q2 2025)

**Plugin ecosystem + policy packs:**

- Plugin marketplace (curated community plugins)
- Pre-built policy packs (PCI, HIPAA, startup-friendly)
- Improved plugin SDK and templates
- CI workflow templates (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Comparison mode (baseline vs current)

## Future (v0.6+ - Q3 2025 and beyond)

**Collaboration layer (paid features):**

- Hosted UI with shared dashboards
- Team workflows (shared policies, approvals)
- CI integration wizard
- Auto-PR creation with fixpacks

**Core engine (remains OSS):**

- Advanced evolution pipeline
- Better tuning heuristics
- Regression testing for rule refinements
- Extended AST patterns

## Long-Term Vision (v1.0+)

**VibeGate becomes the standard quality orchestrator for Python.**

- **OSS:** Powerful free version for solo developers and small teams
- **Paid:** Collaboration features for teams and enterprises
- **Community:** Thriving plugin ecosystem and shared policy packs

## Philosophy

**The deterministic core stays open source forever.**

Paid features focus on collaboration and hosting, not quality checks. See `docs/OPEN_CORE_ROADMAP.md` for detailed phasing and `docs/COMMERCIAL.md` for business context.
