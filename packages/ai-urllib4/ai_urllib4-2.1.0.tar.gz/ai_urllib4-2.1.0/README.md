## Usage Example

You can use urllib4 for your HTTP requests with a simple, intuitive API:

```python3
# Simple GET request
>>> import urllib4
>>> resp = urllib4.request("GET", "http://httpbin.org/robots.txt")
>>> resp.status
200
>>> resp.data
b"User-agent: *\nDisallow: /deny\n"

# POST request with JSON data
>>> import urllib4
>>> import json
>>> data = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
>>> resp = urllib4.request(
...     "POST",
...     "http://httpbin.org/post",
...     headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
...     body=json.dumps(data).encode()
... )
>>> resp.status
200
```

## Installation

You can install urllib4 with pip:

```bash
$ pip install urllib4
```

## Documentation

Documentation is currently limited to code comments and this README. As the project matures, more comprehensive documentation will be developed.

## Roadmap

The following features are planned for future development:

### HTTP/3 Enhancements

- Connection migration for improved reliability
- HTTP/3 priority management
- WebTransport support

### WebSocket Enhancements

- Additional WebSocket extensions
- WebSocket over HTTP/2

### HTTP/2 Support

```python
import urllib4
from urllib4.http2 import inject_into_urllib4, ConnectionProfile

# Enable HTTP/2 support
inject_into_urllib4()

# Create a pool manager with a specific connection profile
http = urllib4.PoolManager(http2_profile=ConnectionProfile.HIGH_PERFORMANCE)

# Make a request (automatically uses HTTP/2 if the server supports it)
response = http.request("GET", "https://nghttp2.org")
print(f"HTTP version: {response.version_string}")
```

### WebSocket Support

```python
from urllib4.websocket import WebSocketConnection

# Connect to a WebSocket server with compression and health monitoring
ws = WebSocketConnection(
    "wss://echo.websocket.org",
    enable_compression=True,
    compression_level=9,
    enable_health_monitoring=True,
    ping_interval=30.0,
    ping_timeout=5.0,
)

# Connect to the server
ws.connect()

# Send a text message
ws.send("Hello, WebSocket!")

# Send a binary message
ws.send(b"\x01\x02\x03\x04")

# Send a structured object using a subprotocol
ws = WebSocketConnection(
    "wss://echo.websocket.org",
    protocols=["json"],
)
ws.connect()
ws.send({"name": "John", "age": 30})  # Automatically encoded as JSON

# Receive a message with timeout
try:
    message = ws.receive(timeout=5.0)
    if isinstance(message, dict):
        print(f"Received JSON: {message}")
    else:
        print(f"Received: {message.text}")
except WebSocketTimeoutError:
    print("Timed out waiting for message")

# Close the connection
ws.close()
```

### WebSocket Extensions and Subprotocols

urllib4 supports various WebSocket extensions and subprotocols:

- **Extensions**:
  - `permessage-deflate`: Compresses WebSocket messages for better performance

- **Subprotocols**:
  - `json`: Automatically encodes/decodes JSON data
  - `msgpack`: Efficiently encodes/decodes MessagePack data (requires `msgpack` package)
  - `cbor`: Efficiently encodes/decodes CBOR data (requires `cbor2` package)

### HTTP/3 Support

```python
import urllib4
from urllib4.http3 import HTTP3Connection, HTTP3Settings, QUICSettings, inject_into_urllib4

# Direct HTTP/3 usage
quic_settings = QUICSettings(
    enable_multipath=True,  # Enable Multipath QUIC
    max_paths=4,
    enable_0rtt=True,       # Enable 0-RTT for faster connections
)

http3_settings = HTTP3Settings(
    quic=quic_settings,
)

# Create an HTTP/3 connection
conn = HTTP3Connection(
    "cloudflare-quic.com",  # A server that supports HTTP/3
    settings=http3_settings,
)

# Connect and make a request
conn.connect()
response = conn.request("GET", "/")
print(f"Status: {response.status}")
print(f"Body: {response.data.decode()[:100]}...")

# Close the connection
conn.close()

# Alternatively, inject HTTP/3 support into urllib4
inject_into_urllib4()

# Now all HTTPS requests will automatically use HTTP/3 when available
http = urllib5.PoolManager()
response = http.request("GET", "https://cloudflare-quic.com/")
```

### AI-Powered Smart Client

`SmartClient` is a high-level HTTP client that uses AI to learn from response patterns and optimize requests.

```python
from ai_urllib4 import SmartClient

# Initialize with AI optimization and your choice of LLM backend
client = SmartClient(
    ai_optimize=True,
    learn_from_success=True,
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",  # Optional: enables LLM-powered expert advice
    ai_provider="gemini",    # Optional: "gemini" (default)
    ai_model="gemini-1.5-flash"
)

# AI will suggest optimal headers/timing and learn from the result
response = client.request("GET", "https://example.com/api")

# Access learned domain insights
insights = client.get_domain_insights("example.com")
print(f"Success rate for example.com: {insights['success_rate']}")

# Detect anomalies or blocks
# (e.g., detecting Cloudflare challenges or sudden protocol changes)
anomaly = client.detect_anomaly(response)
if anomaly["is_anomaly"]:
    print(f"⚠️ Warning: {anomaly['reason']}")
```

Key features:
- **Request Pattern Learning**: Remembers successful timings and headers per domain.
- **Response Classification**: Distinguishes between normal content, challenges (WAF), and blocks.
- **Header Optimization**: Suggests and rotates headers based on learned history.
- **Retry Intelligence**: Adapts retry logic using AI strategies (e.g., increasing delay after a 403).
- **LLM Backends**: Supports pluggable AI expert advice via Gemini and others.
on or unusual site behavior.

### 🚀 AsyncIO Support

First-class support for `asyncio` and `anyio` is now available.

```python
import asyncio
from ai_urllib4.async_connectionpool import connection_from_url

async def main():
    pool = connection_from_url("http://httpbin.org")
    response = await pool.urlopen("GET", "/get")
    print(response)
    await pool.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Enhanced Security Features (Planned)

```python
# This is a planned API - not yet implemented
import urllib4
from urllib4.util.cert_verification import SPKIPinningVerifier, CertificateTransparencyPolicy
from urllib4.util.hsts import HSTSCache, HSTSHandler

# Create a pool manager with SPKI pinning
pins = {
    "example.com": {"pin-sha256:YLh1dUR9y6Kja30RrAn7JKnbQG/uEtLMkBgFF2Fuihg="}
}
http = urllib4.PoolManager(
    spki_pins=pins,
    cert_transparency_policy=CertificateTransparencyPolicy.BEST_EFFORT
)

# Create an HSTS handler
hsts_cache = HSTSCache()
hsts_handler = HSTSHandler(hsts_cache)

# Secure a URL if needed
url = "http://example.com/api"
secured_url = hsts_handler.secure_url(url)  # Returns https://example.com/api if in HSTS cache
```

## Why ai-urllib4? (vs urllib3)

While `ai-urllib4` is built on the solid foundation of `urllib3`, it introduces key differences designed for modern, high-performance applications:

| Feature | urllib3 | ai-urllib4 |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Async Support** | ❌ Synchronous only (blocking) | ✅ **Native AsyncIO** (`async`/`await`) |
| **Configuration** | Manual Tuning | 🤖 **AI Smart Config** (Heuristic optimization) |
| **HTTP/2 & 3** | Experimental / Partial | ✅ **First-Class Support** (Multipath QUIC, etc.) |
| **WebSocket** | Limited / Extension needed | ✅ **Built-in Advanced Support** (Subprotocols, etc.) |

### Key Differentiators:

1.  **🚀 AsyncIO Support**: `ai-urllib4` allows non-blocking requests perfect for apps using `FastAPI`, `Quart`, or standard `asyncio`.
2.  **🤖 AI-Powered Tuning**: The `AISmartConfig` module automatically suggests timeout and retry settings based on the target URL type (API vs Download).
3.  **🔒 Modern Security**: Stronger focus on Certificate Transparency and SPKI Pinning out of the box.

## Security Considerations

urllib4 is designed with security in mind, providing robust SSL/TLS verification, certificate transparency checking, and HSTS support. It's suitable for use in production environments where security is a priority.
