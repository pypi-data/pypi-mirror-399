binary-inspector
================

binary-inspector is a utility to extract symbols from various kinds of binaries,
i.e. ELF, Mach-O, WinPE and other binary formats. It is designed to work as a ScanCode
Toolkit plugin and integrated in ScanCode.io pipelines.

To install run ``pip install binary-inspector`` and use with::

    scancode --json-pp - --macho-symbol --winpe-symbol --verbose <PATH to a tree or file with binaries>

The JSON output will contain binary symbols found in binaries if any.
