A Firestore-based runtime implementation for [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), providing persistent storage and state management for LangGraph applications using Google Cloud Firestore.

## Features

- **Firestore Backend**: Uses Google Cloud Firestore for persistent storage of threads, runs, and assistants
- **Thread Management**: Create, update, and manage conversation threads with full state persistence
- **Run Execution**: Execute LangGraph runs with automatic state checkpointing
- **Assistant Support**: Manage AI assistants with versioned configurations
- **Real-time Streaming**: Stream run outputs and state updates in real-time
- **Background Queue**: Built-in task queue for async run execution
- **State Snapshots**: Retrieve and update thread state at any point in time

## Installation

```bash
pip install langgraph-runtime-firestore
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- A Google Cloud project with Firestore enabled
- Firebase service account credentials

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up Firestore

1. Create a Google Cloud project
2. Enable the Firestore API
3. Create a service account and download the credentials JSON file
4. Set the environment variables:

```bash
export FIRESTORE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/path/to/your/credentials.json
export FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
```

### 2. Use in your application

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from langgraph_runtime_firestore import lifespan

# Create your ASGI application with Firestore runtime
app = Starlette(lifespan=lifespan)
```

### 3. Run with LangGraph CLI

```bash
langgraph dev
```

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `FIRESTORE_CREDENTIALS_PATH` | Path to your Firebase service account credentials JSON file |
| `FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID` | Your Google Cloud project ID |

### Optional Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LANGGRAPH_DISABLE_FILE_PERSISTENCE` | `false` | Disable local file caching |
| `N_JOBS_PER_WORKER` | (varies) | Number of concurrent jobs per worker |

## Architecture

This runtime implements the LangGraph Runtime API with Firestore as the backend:

- **Threads**: Stored in `users/{user}/threads/{thread_id}` collection
- **Runs**: Stored in memory with metadata synced to Firestore
- **Assistants**: Stored in `assistants/{assistant_id}` collection
- **Checkpoints**: Managed through the checkpoint module with optional Firestore persistence
- **Streaming**: In-memory queue-based streaming with message persistence

## Development

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MarcoFurrer/langgraph_runtime_firestore.git
cd langgraph_runtime_firestore

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Check code style
make lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
make format
```
