# Eclipse Ditto Client

Eclipse Ditto Project - https://eclipse.dev/ditto/index.html

This repository is the python client generated using Microsoft Kiota ([https://github.com/microsoft/kiota-python](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota-python)) and a CLI based client.

## Install

```bash
uv add ditto-client
```

## Running Ditto

A sample docker compose is provided as part of this repository.

You must run the ditto services outside the devcontainer as they consume lot of resources.

```bash
# outside your devcontainer (i.e. on your host)
# at <your_path>/ditto-client dir
docker compose -f assets/ditto/docker-compose.yaml up
```

## Usage

```python
auth_provider = BasicAuthProvider(user_name=_USERNAME, password=_PASSWORD)

request_adapter = HttpxRequestAdapter(auth_provider)
request_adapter.base_url = "http://host.docker.internal:8080"

ditto_client = DittoClient(request_adapter)

response = await ditto_client.api.two.things.get()
```

Default setup for Ditto uses Ngix with basic authentication. A custom authentication provider has been included
in the library to support it. See [BasicAuth Provider](src/ditto_client/basic_auth.py).

[See examples/basic.py for the full usage](examples/basic.py)

## Usage - CLI

The Ditto client includes a comprehensive CLI for interacting with Eclipse Ditto services. The CLI provides the following commands:

| Command Group | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `policy`      | Manage access policies                          |
| `thing`       | Manage things (digital twins)                   |
| `search`      | Search for things                               |
| `permission`  | Check permissions                               |
| `devops`      | DevOps operations (logging, config, connection) |


### Global Configuration

The CLI uses the following environment variables, you can set it as per your environment:

```bash
export DITTO_BASE_URL="http://host.docker.internal:8080"
export DITTO_USERNAME="ditto"
export DITTO_PASSWORD="ditto"
export DITTO_DEVOPS_USERNAME="devops"
export DITTO_DEVOPS_PASSWORD="foobar"
```

### Policy Management

#### Create a new policy.

```bash
# Create a new policy
ditto-client policy create "my.sensors:sensor-policy" examples/cli-examples/policy.json
```

#### Retrieve a specific policy by ID.

```bash
# Get a policy
ditto-client policy get "my.sensors:sensor-policy"
```

#### List policy entries.

```bash
# List all policy entries
ditto-client policy entries "my.sensors:sensor-policy"
```

#### Delete policy.

```bash
# Delete a policy
ditto-client policy delete "my.sensors:sensor-policy"
```

---

### Things Management

#### Create a new thing.

```bash
# Make sure to create the policy (my.sensors:sensor-policy) See above example
# Create a new thing
ditto-client thing create "my.sensors:sensor-001" examples/cli-examples/thing.json
```

#### List all things with optional filtering.

```bash
# List all things
ditto-client thing list

# List things with specific fields
ditto-client thing list --fields "thingId,attributes"

# List specific things by ID
ditto-client thing list --ids "my.sensors:sensor-001"
```

#### Retrieve a specific thing by ID.

```bash
# Get a specific thing
ditto-client thing get "my.sensors:sensor-001"

# Get a specific revision of a thing
ditto-client thing get "my.sensors:sensor-001" --revision 1
```

#### Update a thing using JSON file.

```bash
# Update a thing
ditto-client thing update "my.sensors:sensor-001" examples/cli-examples/thing.json
```

#### Compare current thing with historical revision.

```bash
# Compare current state with revision 1
ditto-client thing diff "my.sensors:sensor-001" 1
```

#### Delete a thing.

```bash
# Delete a thing
ditto-client thing delete "my.sensors:sensor-001"
```

### Search Operations

Refer below documentation to understand RQL syntax:
https://eclipse.dev/ditto/1.5/basic-rql.html

#### Search for things using RQL (Resource Query Language).

```bash
# Search all things
ditto-client search query

# Search with filter
ditto-client search query --filter 'eq(attributes/location,"Kitchen")'

# Search with size limit and sorting
ditto-client search query --option "size(3),sort(+thingId)"

# Search in specific namespaces
ditto-client search query --namespaces "my.sensors"
```

#### Count things matching search criteria.

```bash
# Count all things
ditto-client search count

# Count things with filter
ditto-client search count --filter 'eq(attributes/location,"Kitchen")'
```

---

### Connection Management (DevOps)

#### Create a new connection.

```bash
# Create a connection
ditto-client devops connection create "new-connection" examples/cli-examples/connection.json
```

#### List all connections.

```bash
# List all connections
ditto-client devops connection list

# List with specific fields
ditto-client devops connection list --fields "id,connectionStatus"
```

#### Retrieve a specific connection by ID.

```bash
# Get a connection
ditto-client devops connection get "new-connection"

# Get with specific fields
ditto-client devops connection get "new-connection" --fields "id,status"
```

#### Delete a connection.
