        **Schedule automatic deletion of a message after delay.**
            `AutoDelete.run(client, message, 10)`

        This static method schedules a message to be automatically deleted
        after the specified delay in seconds. The deletion runs asynchronously
        in the background.

        Args:
            client (`rubigram.Client`):
                The client instance used to delete the message.

            message (`rubigram.types.UMessage`):
                The message object to be deleted.

            delay (`int`):
                Number of seconds to wait before deleting the message.

        Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            # Send a message and schedule its deletion after 30 seconds
            message = await client.send_message(chat_id, "This will be deleted soon")
            AutoDelete.run(client, message, 30)

        Note:
            - If delay is 0 or negative, no deletion is scheduled
            - Deletion runs as a background task and won't block execution
            - Errors during deletion are logged as warnings but not raised

            `await AutoDelete.auto_delete_task(client, message, 10)`

        This internal method waits for the specified delay and then
        attempts to delete the message. Any exceptions during deletion
        are caught and logged as warnings.

            delay (`int`):
                Number of seconds to wait before deleting the message.

        Note:
            This method is designed to run as a background task and
            should not be called directly. Use `AutoDelete.run()` instead.
