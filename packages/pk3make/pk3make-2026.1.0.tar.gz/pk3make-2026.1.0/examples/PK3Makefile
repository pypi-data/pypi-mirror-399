# === Example PK3Makefile ===
#
# This is a simple example PK3Makefile, more meant to demonstrate what you
# can do with the format than actually being useful. 
#
# Use this for reference when writing your own.

# --- Build options ---
#
# These are your general project options.
# Please note that PK3Make will attempt to replicate
# the file tree in your ?srcdir as needed
#

?srcdir: src # Base file tree where your PNGs, OGGs, etc. are.
?workdir: build # Working directory to store compiled files. Useful for Out-Of-Date checking and debugging
?palette: PLAYPAL # Conventionally PLAYPAL. For use w/ graphics/flats/fades. Used as a basis for COLORMAPs and TINTTABs
?destfile: bin/whatever.pk3


# --- LUMPDEFs ---
#
# LUMPDEFs are read sequentially, so take care where to
# place your "marker" types. The engine will break if you don't.
#
# Although you will need a palette in your ?srcdir,
# "palette" types will be dumped into your PK3.
# To define a default palette for your graphics, use ?palette
