# A tutorial on how to build a Foundation Model for Univariate Time Series Forecasting

[Huggingface Model Card](https://huggingface.co/vilhess/PatchFM)

A transformer-based forecasting model for univariate time series. The approach mirrors Large Language Model (LLM) practices (next-token → next-patch) while remaining lightweight compared to a classic LLM and practical.

## Highlights
- Next-patch prediction objective (autoregressive, causal)
- Patch-based representation of time series (tokens ↔ patches)
- Causal masking self-attention with RoPE (relative positions)
- RevIN (Reversible Instance Normalization) with causal statistics
- SwiGLU feed-forward networks
- Multi-quantile outputs (median + uncertainty bands)
- Efficient rollout with KV caching

## Installation
```bash
pip install patchfm
```

## Quick Start

```python 
import torch
from patchfm import PatchFMConfig, Forecaster

# --- Instantiate model ---
config = PatchFMConfig()
model = Forecaster(config)

# --- Inference ---
forecast_horizon = 64
seq = torch.randn(1, 1024)  # (batch, time)
pred_median, pred_quantiles = model(seq, forecast_horizon=forecast_horizon, quantiles=[0.1, 0.5, 0.9]) # (batch, forecast_horizon), (batch, forecast_horizon, quantiles)
```

We provide an extended quick start example in [notebooks/tutorial.ipynb](./notebooks/tutorial.ipynb).
If you dont have suitable hardware you can run the the extended quick start example example also in Google Colab:

## Method (TL;DR)
- Patching: Split a context signal of length $w$ into $P_{num} = w / P_{len}$ patches of length $P_{len}$.
- RevIN: Normalize patches using causal running mean/variance over past patches, and denormalize outputs to the original scale.
- Architecture: Input residual MLP → stacked Transformer blocks (MHA + SwiGLU FFN, pre-norm, residual) → $|\mathcal{Q}|$ output heads mapping back to patch space.
- Positional encoding: Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) applied to queries/keys.
- Training: Multi-quantile (pinball) loss across positions, elements, and quantiles $\mathcal{Q}$.
- Inference: Predict next patch; roll out autoregressively with KV caching for long horizons.

## Problem Formulation
Given context patches $x_{p_1}, \ldots, x_{p_n}$, predict the next patch $x_{p_{i+1}}$ for each position $i$ using only past patches (causality). The model outputs quantiles $\{\hat{x}_{p_{i+1}}^{(q)}: q \in \mathcal{Q}\}$ with median (q=0.5) as the point forecast.

## Loss: Multi-Quantile (Pinball)
For residual $u = x - \hat{x}^{(q)}$:
$$\rho_q(u) = \begin{cases} q\,u, & u \ge 0,\\ (q-1)\,u, & u < 0. \end{cases}$$
Aggregate over positions, patch elements, and quantiles.

## Architecture
- Input MLP: $\mathbb{R}^{P_{len}} \to \mathbb{R}^{dim}$ residual 2-layer MLP (ReLU)
- Multi-Head Attention: causal mask, RoPE; queries/keys/values per head
- FFN: SwiGLU (SiLU-gated), pre-norm + residual
- Output heads: |Q| linear maps $\mathbb{R}^{dim} \to \mathbb{R}^{P_{len}}$ (one per quantile)

### Model Details
- Patch size: 32
- Max context: 32 patches (1024 steps)
- Forecast horizon: 32 steps per forward pass
- Quantiles $\mathcal{Q}$: {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9}
- Layers: 6
- Attention heads: 64 (head dim 32)
- Model dim: 2048
- Parameters: ~300M

## Inference
- Single step: predict next patch ($P_{len}$ values)
- Long-horizon: append prediction to context and repeat (optionally drop oldest patch to keep window fixed)
- KV caching: reuse cached keys/values for past patches; compute new Q/K/V only for the appended patch
