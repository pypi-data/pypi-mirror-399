"""
Walker traversal demonstration for jvspatial core module.

This example shows how walkers traverse nodes along edges in the
jvspatial object-spatial ORM architecture:
- Objects: Simple units of information stored in database
- Nodes: Modified objects designed to be connected by edges and visited by walkers
- Edges: Connect nodes
- Walkers: Traverse nodes along edges

This demo demonstrates:
1. Creating nodes using entity-centric operations
2. Connecting nodes with edges
3. Traversing the graph using walkers
4. Walker state management and decision-making
