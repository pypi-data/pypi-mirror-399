**BOAT** is a compositional **O**per**A**tion-level **T**oolbox for gradient-based **B**LO.

Unlike existing libraries that typically encapsulate fixed solver routines, BOAT factorizes the BLO workflow into **atomic, reusable primitives**. Through a unified constraint reconstruction perspective, it empowers researchers to **automatically compose** solvers via simple configuration.

This is the **MindSpore-based** version of BOAT (`boat-ms`). It is seamlessly integrated into MindSpore’s computation graph and heterogeneous hardware ecosystem (**Ascend/GPU/CPU**), incorporating the latest **First-Order (FO)** optimization strategies to support emerging large-scale application scenarios.

BOAT supports unified execution across backends via separate branches:
- **[PyTorch-based](https://github.com/callous-youth/BOAT)**: The widely-used standard version.
- **[Jittor-based](https://github.com/callous-youth/BOAT/tree/boat_jit)**: Accelerated version with meta-operators.

## 🔑 Key Features

* **🧩 First-Order Operation Specialization**: Specifically optimized for **First-Order (FO)** BLO methods, enabling fast prototyping on Ascend hardware.
* **🚀 Heterogeneous Hardware Support**: Native compatibility with Huawei **Ascend (NPU)**, GPU, and CPU backends.
* **🏭 Generative Solver Construction**: Supports dynamic serialization of operations. Users can switch between different FO strategies (e.g., VFO, MESO) simply by changing configurations.
* **🛠 Configuration-Driven**: Define complex optimization strategies via simple `JSON` configurations (`boat_config` & `loss_config`), decoupling algorithmic logic from model definitions.
* **✅ Comprehensive Testing**: Achieves **99% code coverage** through rigorous testing, ensuring software robustness.

##  🚀 **Why BOAT?**
Existing automatic differentiation (AD) tools primarily focus on specific optimization strategies, such as explicit or implicit methods, and are often targeted at meta-learning or specific application scenarios, lacking support for algorithm customization. 

In contrast, **BOAT** expands the landscape of Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) applications by supporting a broader range of problem-adaptive operations. It bridges the gap between theoretical research and practical deployment, offering unparalleled flexibility to design, customize, and accelerate BLO techniques.

## 📚 Supported Operation Libraries

<div align="center">

The MindSpore version of BOAT currently focuses on **First-Order (FO)** operations, providing efficient single-level reformulations that avoid expensive Hessian computations.

| Library | Functional Role | Supported Atomic Operations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FO-OL**<br>*(First-Order)* | **Constructs single-level surrogates.**<br>Reformulates the nested problem into first-order objectives using value-functions or penalties. | • **[VFO](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/6dddcff5b115b40c998a08fbd1cea4d7-Abstract-Conference.html)** (Value-Function First-Order / BOME)<br>• **[VSO](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/liu21o.html)** (Value-Function Sequential)<br>• **[MESO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09927)** (Moreau Envelope)<br>• **[PGDO](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shen23c.html)** (Penalty Gradient Descent) |

## 🔨 Installation

BOAT-ms is built on top of **MindSpore**. Please install a suitable version for your hardware (Ascend / GPU / CPU) first.

### 1. Install MindSpore
Follow the [Official Installation Guide](https://www.mindspore.cn/install) or use the reference commands below:

**CPU (Linux-x86_64) Example**
```bash
# 1. Create environment
conda create -n mindspore_py39 python=3.9.11 -y
conda activate mindspore_py39

# 2. Install GCC dependencies (Linux only)
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common -y
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-9 -y

# 3. Install MindSpore (Adjust MS_VERSION as needed)
export MS_VERSION=2.4.1
pip install mindspore==${MS_VERSION} -i [https://repo.mindspore.cn/pypi/simple](https://repo.mindspore.cn/pypi/simple) --trusted-host repo.mindspore.cn
```

### 2. Install BOAT-ms
Once MindSpore is ready, install BOAT-ms via PyPI or Source:
```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install boat-ms

# Or install from Source (Specific Branch)
git clone -b boat_ms --single-branch [https://github.com/callous-youth/BOAT.git](https://github.com/callous-youth/BOAT.git)
cd BOAT
pip install -e .
```

## ⚡ How to Use BOAT

BOAT separates the **problem definition** from the **solver configuration**. Below is a MindSpore-based example.

### 1. Load Configurations
```python
import json
import boat_ms as boat

# Load algorithmic configurations
with open("configs/boat_config.json", "r") as f:
    boat_config = json.load(f)

# Load objective configurations
with open("configs/loss_config.json", "r") as f:
    loss_config = json.load(f)
```
### 2. Define Models and Optimizers
Use standard MindSpore models and optimizers.

```python
import mindspore as ms

# Define models
upper_model = MyUpperModel()
lower_model = MyLowerModel()

# Define optimizers (MindSpore syntax)
upper_opt = ms.nn.Adam(upper_model.trainable_params(), learning_rate=1e-3)
lower_opt = ms.nn.SGD(lower_model.trainable_params(), learning_rate=1e-2)
```
### 3. Customize & Initialize Problem
Specify the First-Order operation (e.g., VFO) and inject runtime objects.
```python
# Configure BOAT with MindSpore models/optimizers
boat_config["fo_ol"] = ["VFO"]  # Select First-Order Operation
boat_config["lower_level_model"] = lower_model
boat_config["upper_level_model"] = upper_model
boat_config["lower_level_opt"] = lower_opt
boat_config["upper_level_opt"] = upper_opt

# Initialize the BOAT core
b_optimizer = boat.Problem(boat_config, loss_config)
```

### 4. Build Solvers
Automatically construct the computation graph for the bilevel strategy.
```python
# Pass optimizers explicitly if needed by the solver backend
b_optimizer.build_ll_solver(lower_opt)
b_optimizer.build_ul_solver(upper_opt)
```

### 5. Run Optimization Loop
```python
# Training loop
for x_itr in range(1000):
    # Prepare data (MindSpore Tensors or dicts)
    ul_feed_dict = {"data": ul_data, "target": ul_target}
    ll_feed_dict = {"data": ll_data, "target": ll_target}
    
    # Run one iteration
    loss, run_time = b_optimizer.run_iter(ll_feed_dict, ul_feed_dict, current_iter=x_itr)
    
    if x_itr % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Iter {x_itr}: UL Loss {loss:.4f}")
```

## 🌍 Applications
