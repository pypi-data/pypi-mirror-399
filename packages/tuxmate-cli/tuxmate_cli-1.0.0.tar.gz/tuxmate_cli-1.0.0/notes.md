<!--
This TODO list outlines the key tasks for improving and maintaining the tuxmate-cli project:

1. Review the architecture, focusing on the three main files within the `src` directory. Ensure that `data.ts` is being updated correctly and evaluate the necessity of implementing a cache.
2. Add an architecture diagram to visually represent the system's structure.
3. Implement tests to ensure code reliability and correctness.
4. Integrate Coderabbit and update the CODEOWNERS file for better code review and ownership management.
5. Update the README file to provide comprehensive and accurate project documentation.
