              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# HedgeTech Python SDK

HedgeTech Python SDK is a professional, lightweight, and modular Python package designed to provide seamless access to HedgeTech services. The SDK is crafted for developers, data analysts, and algorithmic traders who want to interact with the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE & IFB) using a clean, reliable, and easy-to-use API. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous workflows, offering maximum flexibility and performance for different application scenarios.

> **Note:** This SDK requires Python >= 3.10 and is currently in Beta. Some APIs may change in future releases, but it is stable enough for daily use.

## Features

* Secure authentication with both async and sync clients.
* Real-time and historical market data retrieval from TSE & IFB.
* Modular and maintainable architecture, designed to support multiple engines (DataEngine engines, WebSocket clients, etc.).
* Structured request and response types for robust data handling.
* Fully asynchronous support for high-performance applications.
* Easy to integrate into trading bots, analytics pipelines, dashboards, or WebSocket feeds.

## Installation

Install HedgeTech SDK via PyPI:

```
pip install HedgeTech
```

### Updating the Package

To update HedgeTech SDK to the latest version in your environment, use:

```
pip install --upgrade HedgeTech
```

## Usage

The SDK exposes all major clients through the top-level modules, so you generally do **not** need to import internal implementation files directly.

### Authentication

> **Note:** Make sure to use the matching async or sync Auth client depending on your workflow.

#### Async Authentication

```python
from HedgeTech.Auth import AuthAsyncClient

auth_async_client = await AuthAsyncClient.login(
    UserName_or_Email='<YOUR UserName_or_Email>',
    Password='<YOUR Password>'
)
print(auth_async_client.token)
```

#### Sync Authentication

```python
from HedgeTech.Auth import AuthSyncClient

auth_sync_client = AuthSyncClient.login(
    UserName_or_Email='<YOUR UserName_or_Email>',
    Password='<YOUR Password>'
)
print(auth_sync_client.token)
```

### DataEngine / TSE IFB

The DataEngine is designed to support multiple engines in a modular way. Each engine provides its own async and sync clients, structured request and response types, and can be integrated with other engines such as WebSocket clients.

> **Important Note on Sync vs Async:** All clients have the **same method names and behavior** in both Sync and Async versions. The only difference is how they execute: Sync runs in a blocking manner, while Async requires `await` and an event loop. This design allows you to switch between Sync and Async without changing the logic or input/output of your code.

#### Async Data Client

```python
from HedgeTech.DataEngine import DataEngine_TseIfb_AsyncClient

client = DataEngine_TseIfb_AsyncClient(auth_async_client)
data = await client.live_best_limit_by_isin(
    symbol_isins=['IRT1AHRM0001','IRO1IKCO0001']
)
print(data)

# websocket Example

async for update in client.websocket_by_name(
    channels=["best-limit", "order-book"],
    symbol_names=["فملی","اطلس"]
):

    print(update["data"])
```

#### Sync Data Client

```python
from HedgeTech.DataEngine import DataEngine_TseIfb_SyncClient

client = DataEngine_TseIfb_SyncClient(auth_sync_client)
data = client.historical_ohlcv_by_name(
    symbolName='مهرگان',
    start_timestamp=0,
    end_timestamp='1763411432',
    AdjustedPrice=True,
    Resolution='D'
)
print(data)

# websocket Example

for update in client.websocket_by_isin(
    channels=["best-limit", "order-book"],
    symbol_isins=["IR1234567890"]
):

    print(update["data"])
```

## Important Notes for Users

* This SDK requires Python >=3.10.
* The SDK is currently in **Beta** — APIs may change in future releases, but it is usable for most workflows.
* Always install dependencies with the specified versions to avoid compatibility issues.
* Async clients require an asyncio event loop.
* All main clients are exposed through top-level modules; you do not need to access internal files.
* Keywords and classifiers are chosen to make the SDK easy to find for developers working in finance, trading, and data analysis.

## Modules Overview

### HedgeTech.Auth

Handles authentication for all HedgeTech clients. The async (`AuthAsyncClient`) and sync (`AuthSyncClient`) clients are exposed through the top-level Auth module.

### HedgeTech.DataEngine

Handles interactions with the Tehran Stock Exchange IFB and other engines. Provides:

* Async and sync clients for fetching market data.
* Structured request and response types for predictable and robust data handling.
* Modular design that allows integration of additional engines, such as WebSocket clients or future data engines, without modifying the main interface.
