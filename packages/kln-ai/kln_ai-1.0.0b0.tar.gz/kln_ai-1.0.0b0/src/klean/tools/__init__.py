    This decorator marks a function as a tool that can be used by
    SmolKLN agents. Tools are async functions that can be called
    by Claude during analysis.

    Args:
        name: Tool name (e.g., "grep_codebase")
        description: Human-readable description of what the tool does
        schema: Optional JSON Schema for tool parameters

    Example:
        @tool("grep_codebase", "Search for patterns in code")
        async def grep(pattern: str, path: str = ".") -> str:
            # implementation
