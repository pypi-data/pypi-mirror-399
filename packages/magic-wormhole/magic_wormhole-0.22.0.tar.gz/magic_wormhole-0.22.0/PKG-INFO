Get things from one computer to another, safely.

This package provides a library and a command-line tool named `wormhole`,
which makes it possible to get arbitrary-sized files and directories
(or short pieces of text) from one computer to another. The two endpoints are
identified by using identical "wormhole codes": in general, the sending
machine generates and displays the code, which must then be typed into the
receiving machine.

The codes are short and human-pronounceable, using a phonetically-distinct
wordlist. The receiving side offers tab-completion on the codewords, so
usually only a few characters must be typed. Wormhole codes are single-use
and do not need to be memorized.

For complete documentation, please see https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io
or the docs/ subdirectory.

This program uses two servers, whose source code is kept in separate
repositories: the
[mailbox server](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole-mailbox-server),
and the
[transit relay](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole-transit-relay).

## License, Compatibility

Magic-Wormhole is released under the MIT license, see the `LICENSE` file for details.

This library is compatible with Python 3.10 and higher (tested against
versions up to 3.12).

## Packaging, Installation

Magic Wormhole packages are included in many operating systems.
