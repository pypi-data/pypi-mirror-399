Undine is a GraphQL library for Django. It's designed to be easy to use and extend
while providing out-of-the-box solutions for many common issues GraphQL developers face.

**Feature highlights:**

- Automatic generation of GraphQL types from Django models
- Automatic query optimization
- Logically composable filtering
- Ordering based on enums
- Single and bulk mutations, including relations
- Hidden and input-only mutation inputs
- Built-in permission and validation hooks
- Support for Relay Global object IDs and Connection pagination
- File uploads based on GraphQL multipart request specification
- Support for asynchronous execution
- Subscriptions with websockets
- Optional persisted documents support
- Lifecycle hooks for customizing the GraphQL request cycle
- Hiding fields and types from schema (experimental)
- Built-in testing tools
