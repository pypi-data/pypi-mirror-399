# Project Plan

## For Conversational Search Demo Suite

- **Version:** 0.1
- **Author:** Codex
- **Date:** 2025-11-25
- **Status:** Approved

## Overview

Execution plan to ship the five conversational search demo workflows that showcase the node package across ingestion, retrieval, conversation, production guardrails, and evaluation. Each milestone aligns with the demo design to ensure runnable artifacts, sample data, and documentation are delivered together.
