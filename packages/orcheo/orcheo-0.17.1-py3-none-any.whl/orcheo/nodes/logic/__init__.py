"""Logic nodes split across focused modules for maintainability.

DEPRECATION NOTICE:
The branching logic (IfElseNode, SwitchNode, WhileNode) has been moved to the
edge system at orcheo.edges.branching. These are now edges (IfElse, Switch, While)
rather than nodes, as they handle routing decisions rather than data transformations.

Please update your imports:
- from orcheo.nodes.logic import IfElseNode → from orcheo.edges import IfElse
- from orcheo.nodes.logic import SwitchNode → from orcheo.edges import Switch
- from orcheo.nodes.logic import WhileNode → from orcheo.edges import While

Condition-related utilities have also moved to orcheo.edges.conditions.
