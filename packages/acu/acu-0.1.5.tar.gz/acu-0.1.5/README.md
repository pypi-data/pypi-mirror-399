# acu

Early-stage alpha for the `acu` Python/Rust binding. Packaging is wired for maturin with `uv`
builds.

## Usage

Nothing stable yet; expect breaking changes. Install from a tagged build once published to PyPI.

## Development

- Build locally: `uv build`
- Run publish workflow: push a tag matching `v*` (e.g., `v0.0.1`).
