This is a package that has been patched for excellent third-party libraries such as opencv and pytorch.

All useful functional functions written by individuals

I will also integrate algorithms I have previously written

## Update log
`1.4.0` This will be a new version, which has removed many useless functions and reassigned each function appropriately.
