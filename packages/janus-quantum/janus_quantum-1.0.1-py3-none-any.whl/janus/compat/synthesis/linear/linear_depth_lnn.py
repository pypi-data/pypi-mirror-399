Optimize the synthesis of an n-qubit circuit contains only CX gates for
linear nearest neighbor (LNN) connectivity.
The depth of the circuit is bounded by 5*n, while the gate count is approximately 2.5*n^2

    Synthesis algorithm for linear reversible circuits from [1], section 7.
    This algorithm synthesizes any linear reversible circuit of :math:`n` qubits over
    a linear nearest-neighbor architecture using CX gates with depth at most :math:`5n`.

    Args:
        mat: A boolean invertible matrix.

    Returns:
        The synthesized quantum circuit.

    Raises:
        JanusError: if ``mat`` is not invertible.
