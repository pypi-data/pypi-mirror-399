# nocd
Run commands in another directory withinout cd

Warning: this is pure vibe code for now. It will become less so if I add features; or people use it

## Motivation
With llms I find myself managing more tasks at the same time while waiting for LLMs to finish and generally doing more stuff. This command lets you run commands in a different directory.

## Alternatives and prior work
You could run do this with subshells in bash

```
( cd ~/directory/blah ; command ; )
```

But this is more typing than I am willing to do. You could set up an alias for this. But I like my setup to be in globally installable pip packages where possible.


## Installation
You can install this with pipx

```
pipx install nocd
```

## Usage

Add a diretory for looking for directories

```
nocd --add-dir directory
```


```
nocd sub ls
```

Run ls in subdirectory of directory.
