"""This module provides actions related to novel generation and management.

It includes classes such as GenerateNovel for creating novels based on prompts,
and DumpNovel for saving generated novels to a specified file path. These actions
leverage capabilities from the fabricatio_core and interact with both Python and
Rust components to perform their tasks.
