# Treatment Group MCP-U: Generate BibTeX with MCP-DBLP (Unmediated)

**Important:** Before starting, read the MCP resource `dblp://instructions` from the mcp-dblp server. It contains detailed guidance on using the DBLP tools and the correct workflow.

## Task

Given informal citations, generate a complete BibTeX file using MCP-DBLP tools with unmediated export.

## Instructions

1. **First:** Read the MCP resource `dblp://instructions`
2. Follow the workflow described there:
   - Search in batches of 5-10
   - Add entries IMMEDIATELY after each batch
   - Export once at the end
3. If a paper is not found, note it in your report

## Output

After export_bibtex creates the .bib file, copy it to the designated output location.

Report:
- Number of citations found vs not found
- The filepath of the exported .bib file
- List any citations that could not be found
