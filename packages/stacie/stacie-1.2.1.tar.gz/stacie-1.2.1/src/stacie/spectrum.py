    The spectrum amplitudes are computed as follows:

    .. math::

        C_k = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M \frac{F_m h}{2 N} \left|
            \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x^{(m)}_n \exp\left(-i \frac{2 \pi n k}{N}\right)
        \right|^2

    where:

    - :math:`F_m` is the given prefactor (may be different for each sequence),
    - :math:`h` is the timestep,
    - :math:`N` is the number of time steps in the input sequences,
    - :math:`M` is the number of independent sequences,
    - :math:`x^{(m)}_n` is the value of the :math:`m`-th sequence at time step :math:`n`,
    - :math:`k` is the frequency index.

    The sum over :math:`m` simply averages spectra obtained from different sequences.
    The factor :math:`F_m h/ 2 N` normalizes the spectrum so that its zero-frequency limit
    is an estimate of the autocorrelation integral.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequences
        The input sequences, which can have several forms.
        If ``prefactors`` is not ``None``, it can be:

        - An array with shape ``(nindep, nstep)`` or ``(nstep,)``.
          In case of a 2D array, each row is a time-dependent sequence.
          In case of a 1D array, a single sequence is used.
        - An iterable whose items are arrays as described in the previous point.
          This option is convenient when a single array does not fit in memory.

        If ``prefactors`` is ``None``:

        - A tuple of a prefactor (or an array of prefactors) and a sequences array,
          either 1D or 2D as described above.
        - An iterable whose items are tuples of a prefactor (or an array of prefactors)
          and a sequences array, either 1D or 2D as described above.

        All sequences are assumed to be statistically independent and have length ``nstep``.
        (Time correlations within one sequence are fine, obviously.)
        We recommend using multiple independent sequences to reduce uncertainties.
        Arrays must be used. (lists of floating point values are not supported.)
    prefactors
        A positive factor to be multiplied with the autocorrelation function
        to give it a physically meaningful unit.
        This argument can be given in multiple forms:

        - None, in which case the sequences are assumed to be
          one or more (prefactors, sequences) tuples.
        - A single floating point value: the same prefactor is used for all input sequences.
        - A single array with shape ``(nindep,)``:
          each sequence is multiplied with the corresponding prefactor.
        - An iterable whose items are of the form described in the previous two points.
          In this case, the sequences must also be given as an iterable with the same length.
    timestep
        The time step of the input sequence.
    include_zero_freq
        When set to False, the DC component of the spectrum is discarded.

    Returns
    -------
    spectrum
        A :class:`Spectrum` object holding all the inputs needed to estimate
        the integral of the autocorrelation function.
        This can be used as input to :func:`stacie.estimate.estimate_acint`.
