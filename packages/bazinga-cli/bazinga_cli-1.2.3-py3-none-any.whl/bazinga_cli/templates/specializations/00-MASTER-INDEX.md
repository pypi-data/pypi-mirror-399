## Version Guard Syntax

Templates use HTML comments for version-conditional content:

```markdown
<!-- version: java >= 14 -->
```java
public record User(String name, String email) {}
```

<!-- version: java < 14 -->
```java
public final class User {
    private final String name;
    private final String email;
    // Constructor, getters, equals, hashCode...
}
```
```

**Supported operators:** `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, `==`

---

## Style Signal Syntax

Templates conditionally include patterns based on detected codebase style:

```markdown
<!-- style: uses_lombok -->
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class UserService { ... }

<!-- style: !uses_lombok -->
public class UserService {
    public UserService(UserRepository repo) { ... }
}
```

**Common style signals:**
- `uses_lombok` - Java Lombok annotations
- `uses_decorators` - TypeScript/Python decorators
- `constructor_injection` - DI via constructor
- `field_injection` - DI via field annotations
- `functional_style` - Functional programming patterns
- `oop_style` - Object-oriented patterns

---

## Template Combination Rules

1. **Max 3 templates** combined per specialization block
2. **Token budget:** ≤500 tokens total after combination
3. **Priority order:** Language (1) > Framework (2) > Domain (3)
4. **Deduplication:** Overlapping patterns merged automatically

**Example combinations:**
| Project Type | Templates Combined |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Java Spring API | java + spring-boot + backend-api |
| React TypeScript SPA | typescript + react + (none) |
| Python FastAPI ML | python + fastapi + machine-learning |
| Go Microservice | go + gin-fiber + microservices |
| Node Express API | typescript + express + backend-api |

**Frameworks:** SolidJS, Remix, Qwik, Preact, Ember, Backbone, Phoenix (covered in Elixir), Actix (covered in Rust)

**Databases:** CockroachDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, DynamoDB, SQLite (covered in SQL), MariaDB (covered in MySQL)

**Infrastructure:** Pulumi, Ansible, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, Azure, GCP

**Testing:** Mocha, Jasmine, Ava, TestCafe, Selenium

**Tools:** Webpack, Rollup, Vite, Bun, Deno

These can be added as needed based on project requirements.
