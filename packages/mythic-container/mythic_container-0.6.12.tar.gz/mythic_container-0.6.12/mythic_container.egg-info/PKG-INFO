# Mythic Payload Type Container

The `mythic_container` library provides the steps for defining and utilizing payload types, c2 profiles, translation containers, webhook containers, and logging containers for Mythic. 
Mythic is a Command and Control (C2) framework for Red Teaming with the code on GitHub (https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic) and the Mythic project's documentation on GitBooks (https://docs.mythic-c2.net).

mythic_container.mythic_service.start_and_run_forever()
```
