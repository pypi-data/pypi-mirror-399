# pygacity

> A Python package to enable high-throughput generation of problems suitable for exams and problem sets for thermodynamics courses

You may have learned how to use Python to solve thermodynamics problems, like equilibrium compositions for a reacting system, or phase compositions in vapor-liquid equilibrium.  `Pygacity` takes this idea and uses Python to generate new problems.  The problems are generated in such a way that they can be typeset into PDF's using LaTeX.  `Pygacity` relies on the `pythontex` package in LaTeX to allow Python code to run during document compilation and results of those calculations automatically included in the document.

## Installation

`Pygacity` can be installed from Pypi the usual way:
```sh
pip install pygacity
```

`Pygacity` is under active development.  To install a bleeding edge version:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:cameronabrams/pygacity.git
cd pygacity
pip install -e .
```

`Pygacity` includes the LaTeX class file `autoprob.cls` under `[INSTALL-DIR]/pygacity/resources/autoprob-package/tex/latex/`.  All `latex`-like commands that are managed by `pygacity` append this directory in a ``--include-directory`` argument.  If you would like to use `autoprob.cls` outside of `pygacity`, you will need to make your LaTeX installation aware of `autoprob-package` root.
