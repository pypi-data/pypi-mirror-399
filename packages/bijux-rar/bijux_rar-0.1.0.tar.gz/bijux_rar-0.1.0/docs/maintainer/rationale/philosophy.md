## Philosophy
STATUS: EXPLANATORY

Evidence must be re-verified at the byte level or it is ignored. Replay outranks performance because reproducibility is the guard against drift and tampering. Claims without span+hash grounding are rejected. Auditability is a first-class goal; unverifiable behavior is treated as failure. Users must accept fixed constraints; otherwise, use something else.
