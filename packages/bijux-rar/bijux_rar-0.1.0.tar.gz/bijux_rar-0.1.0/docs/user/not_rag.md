## Why bijux-rar Is NOT a RAG Framework
STATUS: EXPLANATORY

- Does not orchestrate LLMs, vector DBs, or retrieval pipelines; it enforces deterministic reasoning traces.
- Does not optimize ranking or retrieval quality; it only grounds claims via span+hash.
- Verification here is provenance and structure, not factual truth.
- Replay and determinism outrank flexibility; experimentation without grounding is out of scope.
- If you want flexible orchestration or chat workflows, use a RAG toolkit; bijux-rar will reject that use case.***
