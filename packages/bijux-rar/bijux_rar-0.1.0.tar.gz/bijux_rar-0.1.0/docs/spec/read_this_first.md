STATUS: EXPLANATORY

Who: audit-focused engineers willing to accept constraints. Not for casual prototyping.

bijux-rar enforces byte-level evidence grounding, fails closed on any invariant violation, and refuses to run without pinned artifacts. Casual or exploratory use will feel hostile. If you cannot accept span+hash citations, deterministic replay, and fixed pipelines, stop here. If you proceed, you accept that convenience is sacrificed for auditability and that misuse results in rejection, not warnings.
