KELE is a forward-chaining inference engine based on [Assertion Logic](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-63703-7_9), implementing a subset of the logic.

It supports **term-level facts**, **nested terms**, **equivalence axioms**, and **operators with functions**, and integrates well with modern Python (3.13+). You can embed your tools through operator implementations (and embed KELE into your tools), while we leave the burden of wrapping/binding other languages to developers rather than users.

> ⚠️ **Project status**  \
> We released the first alpha version on **12/31** and will move it to a beta release as soon as possible after the holiday. The engine will maintain backward compatibility for commonly used public classes and modules, while internal components are still evolving and under active development.

### ✨ Features

- **Term-level facts and reasoning**: term-centric organization and inference, suited for equality knowledge
- **Equivalence axioms**: convenient equivalence expressions with internal maintenance
- **Nested compound terms**: operators can nest to build complex structures
- **Implement functions for operators**: implement functions for operators (e.g., arithmetic, equation solving)

> Implement functions for operators ≈ Prolog meta-predicates / ASP HEX external predicates (not identical semantics, similar usage).

### 🔍 Matching semantics

- **Loose matching**: treat subsumption as "intersection" matching, without input/constraint distinction
- **Concept overlap check**: returns whether there is a non-empty common concept set aligned
- **Mismatch handling**: incompatible

### 🔧 Installation

#### Option A: PyPI (after release)

You can grab the latest built wheel from GitHub Actions or install a published release directly.

```bash
pip install kele
```

#### Option B: Build from source

> **Requirements**: Python 3.13+; Rust toolchain (`rustup`); on Windows, MSVC (Visual Studio Build Tools).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USTC-KnowledgeComputingLab/KELE
cd KELE
uv sync
uv run maturin develop --skip-install  # install rust and MSVC (Windows) beforehand
```

### 🚀 Quick start

> Full example: `examples/relationship_quick_start.py`

```bash
uv run python examples/relationship_quick_start.py
# Output: grandparent relation inference result (forward-chaining demo)
```

### 🧩 Core syntax at a glance

| Type              | Meaning                                     | Example/Hint                                         |
| ----------------- |---------------------------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `Concept`         | Group of objects sharing something in common | `Person = Concept("Person")`                        |
| `Constant`        | Object (belongs to concepts)                | `alice = Constant("Alice", Person)`                 |
| `Variable`        | Placeholder in rules/queries                | `X = Variable("X")`                                 |
| `Operator`        | Map a tuple of objects into a single one    | `parent(Person, Person) -> Bool`                     |
| `CompoundTerm`    | Operator + arguments                        | `CompoundTerm(parent, [alice, bob])`                 |
| `Assertion`       | “term = term” assertion                     | `Assertion(..., ...)`           |
| `Formula`         | Combine assertions with AND/OR/…            | `Formula(A, "AND", B)`                              |
| `Rule`            | body → head                                 | `Rule(head=..., body=...)`                  |
| `QueryStructure`  | Query input (premises + question)           | `QueryStructure(premises=[...], question=[...])`     |
| `InferenceEngine` | Engine core                                 | `InferenceEngine(facts=[...], rules=[...])`          |

`examples/relationship_quick_start.py` shows a family-relation inference example, illustrating how the pieces fit together:

1. Define concepts (`Concept`) and operators (`Operator`), such as `Person`, `parent`, `grandparent`.
2. Add initial facts (`Assertion`), e.g. “Bob is Alice’s parent”.
3. Write rules (`Rule` + `Formula`), e.g. “if parent(X, Y) and parent(Y, Z), then grandparent(X, Z)”.
4. Build a query (`QueryStructure`) and run `InferenceEngine`.

Example snippet (imports/details omitted; see `examples/relationship_quick_start.py` for a runnable version):

```python
# 1. Define concepts and operators
Person = Concept("Person")
...

# 2. Add facts
alice = Constant("Alice", Person)
...

facts = [
    # parent(Alice, Bob) = True
    Assertion(CompoundTerm(parent, [alice, bob]), true_const),
    ...
]

# 3. Define rules + query
rules = [Rule(
    head=...,
    body=...,
)]

engine = InferenceEngine(facts=facts, rules=rules)
query = QueryStructure(premises=facts, question=[...])  # e.g., ask for grandparent(Alice, X)

print(engine.infer_query(query))
```
