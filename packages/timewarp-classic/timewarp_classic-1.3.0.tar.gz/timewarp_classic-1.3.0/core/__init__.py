The core module is designed to be lightweight and focused on program execution,
with all GUI components handled by the main Time_Warp.py application.

Supported Languages:
- TW PILOT: Educational language with turtle graphics
- TW BASIC: Classic line-numbered programming
- TW Logo: Turtle graphics programming
- TW Pascal: Structured programming
- TW Prolog: Logic programming
- TW Forth: Stack-based programming
- Perl: Modern scripting
- Python: Full Python execution
- JavaScript: JavaScript execution

Usage:
    from core.interpreter import Time_WarpInterpreter
    interpreter = Time_WarpInterpreter()
    interpreter.run_program("T:Hello World!")
