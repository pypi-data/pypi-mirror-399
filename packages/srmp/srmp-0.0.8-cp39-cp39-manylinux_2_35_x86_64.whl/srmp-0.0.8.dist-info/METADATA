**SRMP** is a motion planning software for robotic manipulation, leveraging state-of-the-art search-based algorithms. It ensures consistent and predictable motions, backed by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Additionally, SRMP can efficiently plan for up to dozens of manipulators while guaranteeing collision-free execution—both between robots and with the environment—while maintaining motion consistency and predictability.

## Why SRMP?
Existing motion planning frameworks often struggle with the demands of high-stakes applications, where predictability and repeatability are critical. 
SRMP addresses these challenges by leveraging search-based planning methods, ensuring motions that are both efficient and reliable. 
Whether you're working on robotic manipulation, industrial automation, or large-scale multi-robot coordination, SRMP provides a powerful solution tailored to your needs.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Robot Motion Planning**: First-of-its-kind support for planning coordinated motions in multi-manipulator systems.
- **Reliable and Consistent Trajectories**: Generates predictable and repeatable motions, making it ideal for high-precision and safety-critical applications.
- **Seamless Integration**: Compatible with major simulators, including MuJoCo, Sapien, Genesis, PyBullet and Isaac.
- **Multi-Lingual**: Available in both Python and C++ for easy integration into research and industrial workflows.
- **MoveIt! Plugin**: Enables deployment on real-world robotic systems with minimal setup.
