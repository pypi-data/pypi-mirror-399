Auto-generated models from OpenAPI spec v3.1.2.

These models are automatically generated from the HOPX VM Agent API OpenAPI specification.
DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY - regenerate using scripts/generate_models.sh

All models are type-safe Pydantic v2 models with built-in validation.

Usage:
    from hopx_ai._generated import ExecuteRequest, ExecuteResponse

    request = ExecuteRequest(code="print('hello')", language="python")
    # Pydantic validates automatically!
