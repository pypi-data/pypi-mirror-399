Description:  Benchmarks a disk with multithreaded I/O.

Usage:  diskbench.sh path=<path> data=<8g> passes=<2> threads=<>

Parameters:
path=           Location to read and write.
data=8g         Number of bytes to process per pass.
threads=        Number of threads to use.  By default, all logical threads.
                In RW mode the number of active threads is doubled.
mode=rw         I/O mode:
                   r:  Test read speed only.
                   w:  Test write speed only.
                   rw: Test read and write speed simultaneously.

Processing parameters:
None yet!

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will
                specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
