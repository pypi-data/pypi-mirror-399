Description:  Finds and trims junctions in mapped Hi-C reads.
For the purpose of reporting junction motifs, this requires paired-end reads,
because only improper pairs will be considered as possibly containing
junctions.  However, all reads that map with soft-clipping will be trimmed
on the 3' (right) end, regardless of pairing status.

Usage:  processhi-c.sh in=<mapped reads> out=<trimmed reads>

Parameters:
in=<file>       A sam/bam file containing mapped reads.
out=<file>      Output file of trimmed reads.
overwrite=f     (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than
                overwrite an existing file.
printkmers=t    Generate files with kmer counts at junction sites.
junctions=junctions_k%.txt  File pattern for junction output.

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will
                specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
