Description:  Grades mapping correctness of a sam file of synthetic reads with headers generated by RandomReads3.java

Usage:   gradesam.sh in=<sam file> reads=<number of reads>

Parameters:
in=<file>       Specify the input sam file, or stdin.
reads=<int>     Number of reads in mapper's input (i.e., the fastq file).
thresh=20       Max deviation from correct location to be considered 'loosely correct'.
blasr=f         Set to 't' for BLASR output; fixes extra information added to read names.
ssaha2=f        Set to 't' for SSAHA2 or SMALT output; fixes incorrect soft-clipped read locations.
quality=3       Reads with a mapping quality of this or below will be considered ambiguously mapped.
bitset=t        Track read ID's to detect secondary alignments.
                Necessary for mappers that incorrectly output multiple primary alignments per read.
