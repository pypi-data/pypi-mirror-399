Description:   Splits sequences according to their taxonomy,
as determined by the sequence name.  Sequences should
be labeled with a gi number, NCBI taxID, or species name.

Usage:  splitbytaxa.sh in=<input file> out=<output pattern> tree=<tree file> table=<table file> level=<name or number>

Input may be fasta or fastq, compressed or uncompressed.


Standard parameters:
in=<file>       Primary input.
out=<file>      Output pattern; must contain % symbol.
overwrite=f     (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than
                overwrite an existing file.
showspeed=t     (ss) Set to 'f' to suppress display of processing speed.
ziplevel=2      (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change compression
                level; lower compression is faster.

Processing parameters:
level=phylum    Taxonomic level, such as phylum.  Filtering will operate on
                sequences within the same taxonomic level as specified ids.
tree=           A taxonomic tree made by TaxTree, such as tree.taxtree.gz.
table=          A table translating gi numbers to NCBI taxIDs.
                Only needed if gi numbers will be used.
                On Genepool, use 'tree=auto table=auto'.
* Note *
Tree and table files are in /global/projectb/sandbox/gaag/bbtools/tax
For non-Genepool users, or to make new ones, use taxtree.sh and gitable.sh

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding automatic
                memory detection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify
                200 megs.  The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
