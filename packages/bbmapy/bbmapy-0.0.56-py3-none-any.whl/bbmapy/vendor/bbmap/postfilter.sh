Description:  Maps reads, then filters an assembly by contig coverage.
Intended to reduce misassembly rate of SPAdes by removing suspicious contigs.

Usage:  postfilter.sh in=<reads> ref=<contigs> out=<filtered contigs>

Standard Parameters:
in=<file>           File containing input reads.
in2=<file>          Optional file containing read mates.
ref=<file>          File containing input assembly.
cov=covstats.txt    File to write coverage stats generated by pileup.
out=filtered.fa     Destination of clean output assembly.
outdirty=<file>     (outd) Destination of removed contigs; optional.
ow=f                (overwrite) Overwrites files that already exist.
app=f               (append) Append to files that already exist.
zl=4                (ziplevel) Set compression level, 1 (low) to 9 (max).
int=f               (interleaved) Determines whether input reads are considered interleaved.

Filtering Parameters:
minc=2              (mincov) Discard contigs with lower average coverage.
minp=95             (minpercent) Discard contigs with a lower percent covered bases.
minr=6              (minreads) Discard contigs with fewer mapped reads.
minl=400            (minlength) Discard shorter contigs.
trim=0              (trimends) Trim the first and last X bases of each sequence.

Mapping Parameters (unlisted params will use BBMap defaults)
minhits=2
maxindel=0
tipsearch=0
bw=20
rescue=f

Java Parameters:
-Xmx                This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                    -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.
                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom               This flag will cause the process to exit if an
                    out-of-memory exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da                 Disable assertions.

Other parameters will be passed directly to BBMap.
