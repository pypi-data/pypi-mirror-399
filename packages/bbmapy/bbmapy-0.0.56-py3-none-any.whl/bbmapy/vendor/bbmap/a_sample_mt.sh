Description:  Does nothing.  Should be fast.
This is a template for making wrappers for new tools.

Usage:  a_sample_mt.sh in=<input file> out=<output file>

Input may be fasta or fastq, compressed or uncompressed.

Standard parameters:
in=<file>       Primary input, or read 1 input.
in2=<file>      Read 2 input if reads are in two files.
out=<file>      Primary output, or read 1 output.
out2=<file>     Read 2 output if reads are in two files.
ziplevel=2      (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change compression
                level; lower compression is faster.

Processing parameters:
None yet!

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will
                specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
