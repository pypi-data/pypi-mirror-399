Description:  Cuts out sequences between primers identified in sam files.
Intended for use with sam files generated by msa.sh; one sam file for the
forward primer, and one for the reverse primer.

Usage:	cutprimers.sh in=<file> out=<file> sam1=<file> sam2=<file>

Parameters:

in=<file>       File containing reads. in=stdin.fa will pipe from stdin.
out=<file>      Output sequences. out=stdout will pipe to stdout.
sam1=<file>     Sam file containing mapped locations of primer sequence 1.
sam2=<file>     Sam file containing mapped locations of primer sequence 2.
fake=t          Output 1bp 'N' reads in cases where there is no primer.
include=f       Include the flanking primer sequences in output.

Java Parameters:

-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding automatic
                memory detection. -Xmx20g will specify 
                20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.  
                The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
