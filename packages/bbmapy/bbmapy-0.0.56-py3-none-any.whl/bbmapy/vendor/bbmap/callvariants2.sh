#Running callvariants2.sh is equivalent to running callvariants.sh with the "multi" flag.
#See callvariants.sh for usage information.

#callvariants2 is intended for multiple sam/bam files, one from each sample, which should have variants called independently; the point is that allele frequencies will be reported for ALL samples at locations where ANY sample has a variant called.
#callvariants2 is NOT a better version of callvariants, it's the same, just designed for multisample processing.
#If you have only 1 sample (regardless of how many sam/bam files there are) you should use callvariants.sh without the "multi" flag.
