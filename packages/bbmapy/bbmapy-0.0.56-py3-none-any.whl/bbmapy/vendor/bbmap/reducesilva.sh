Description:  Reduces Silva entries down to one entry per taxa (the first).
This is accomplished by splitting the semicolon-delimited name on semicolons,
and assuming everything is in the form of:
kingdom;phylum;class;order;family;genus;species
...so it's not very reliable.

Usage:  reducesilva.sh in=<file> out=<file> column=<1>

Parameters:
column          The taxonomic level.  0=species, 1=genus, etc.
ow=f            (overwrite) Overwrites files that already exist.
zl=4            (ziplevel) Set compression level, 1 (low) to 9 (max).
fastawrap=70    Length of lines in fasta output.

Sampling parameters:
reads=-1        Set to a positive number to only process this many INPUT sequences, then quit.

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.
                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
