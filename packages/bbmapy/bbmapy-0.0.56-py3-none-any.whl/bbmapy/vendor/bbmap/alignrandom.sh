Description:  Statistical analysis tool that calculates the Average Nucleotide
Identity (ANI) between random DNA sequences. Generates pairs of random 
sequences of specified lengths, aligns them, and produces a histogram of 
identity distributions. This demonstrates that random sequences converge to
varying, length-dependent identity approaching roughly approximately 55%,
with standard deviation decreasing with length, providing a baseline for
evaluating the significance of real sequence alignments.

Usage:  alignrandom.sh <start> <mult> <steps> <iters> <buckets> <maxloops> <output>

Positional Parameters and Defaults (optional, ordered, without the name):
start=10        Starting sequence length for analysis
mult=10         Length multiplier between intervals (each step: length*=mult)
steps=4         Number of length intervals to test 
iters=200       Number of random sequence pairs to align per interval
buckets=100     Number of histogram bins for identity distribution
maxloops=max    Maximum total alignments to prevent excessive runtime
output=stdout   Output file for ANI histogram results

Example:
alignrandom.sh 20 5 6 500
Tests lengths 20, 100, 500, 2500, 12500, 62500 with 500 iterations each.

Output:
Produces a tab-delimited histogram showing the distribution of alignment
identities for random sequence pairs at each tested length.
