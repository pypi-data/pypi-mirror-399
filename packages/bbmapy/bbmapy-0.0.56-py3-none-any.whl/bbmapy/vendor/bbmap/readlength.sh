Description:  Generates a length histogram of input reads.

Usage:	readlength.sh in=<input file>

Parameters:
in=<file>    	The 'in=' flag is needed only if the input file is not the first parameter.  'in=stdin.fq' will pipe from standard in.
in2=<file>   	Use this if 2nd read of pairs are in a different file.
out=<file>   	Write the histogram to this file.  Default is stdout.
bin=10       	Set the histogram bin size.
max=80000    	Set the max read length to track.
round=f      	Places reads in the closest bin, rather than the highest bin of at least readlength.
nzo=t        	(nonzeroonly) Do not print empty bins.
reads=-1     	If nonnegative, stop after this many reads.
