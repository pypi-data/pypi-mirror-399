Description:  Aligns all to all to produce an identity matrix.

Usage:  alltoall.sh in=<input file> out=<output file>

Input may be fasta or fastq, compressed or uncompressed.

Standard parameters:
in=<file>       Input sequences.
out=<file>      Output data.
t=              Set the number of threads; default is logical processors.
overwrite=f     (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than
                overwrite an existing file.
showspeed=t     (ss) Set to 'f' to suppress display of processing speed.
ziplevel=2      (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change compression
                level; lower compression is faster.
reads=-1        If positive, quit after this many sequences.

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will
                specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
