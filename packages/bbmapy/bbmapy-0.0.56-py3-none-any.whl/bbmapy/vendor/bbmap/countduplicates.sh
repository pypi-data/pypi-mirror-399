Description:  Counts duplicate sequences probabilistically,
using around 20 bytes per unique read.  Read pairs are treated
as a single read.  Reads are converted to a hashcode and only
the hashcode is stored when tracking duplicates, so (rare) hash
collisions will result in false positive duplicate detection.
Optionally outputs the deduplicated and/or duplicate reads.

Usage:  countduplicates.sh in=<input file>

Input may be fasta, fastq, or sam, compressed or uncompressed.
in2, out2, and outd2 are accepted for paired files.

Standard parameters:
in=<file>       Primary input, or read 1 input.
out=<file>      Optional output for deduplicated reads.
outd=<file>     Optional output for duplicate reads.  An extension like .fq
                will output reads; .txt will output headers only.
stats=stdout    May be replaced by a filename to write stats to a file.
showspeed=t     (ss) Set to 'f' to suppress display of processing speed.

Processing parameters (these are NOT mutually exclusive):
bases=t         Include bases when generating hashcodes. 
names=f         Include names (headers) when generating hashcodes.
qualities=f     Include qualities when generating hashcodes.
maxfraction=-1.0  Set to a positive number 0-1 to FAIL input
                  that exceeds this fraction of reads with duplicates.
maxrate=-1.0    Set to a positive number >=1 to FAIL input that exceeds this
                average duplication rate (the number of copies per read).
failcode=0      Set to some other number like 1 to produce a
                non-zero exit code for failed input.
samplerate=1.0  Fraction of reads to subsample, to conserve memory.  Sampling
                is deterministic - if a read is sampled, copies will be too.
                Unsampled reads are not sent to any output stream or counted 
                in statistics.

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will
                specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
