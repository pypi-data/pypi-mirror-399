Description:  Compresses or decompresses files based on extensions.
This only exists because the syntax and default behavior of many
compression utilities is unintuitive; it is just a wrapper, and
relies on existing executables in the command line (pigz, lbzip, etc.)
Does not delete the input file.
Does not untar files.

Usage:  unzip.sh in=<file> out=<file>

Parameters:
in=<file>       Input file.
out=<file>      Output file for good reads.
zl=             Set the compression level; 0-9 or 11.

Please contact Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov if you encounter any problems.
