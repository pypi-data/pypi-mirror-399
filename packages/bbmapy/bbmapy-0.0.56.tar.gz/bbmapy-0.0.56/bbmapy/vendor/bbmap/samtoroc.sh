Description:  Creates a ROC curve from a sam file of synthetic reads with headers generated by RandomReads3.java

Usage:  samtoroc.sh in=<sam file> reads=<number of reads in input fastq>

Parameters:
in=<file>       Specify the input sam file, or stdin.
thresh=20       Max deviation from correct location to be considered 'loosely correct'.
blasr=f         Set to 't' for BLASR output; fixes extra information added to read names.
ssaha2=f        Set to 't' for SSAHA2 or SMALT output; fixes incorrect soft-clipped read locations.
bitset=t        Track read ID's to detect secondary alignments.
                Necessary for mappers that incorrectly output multiple primary alignments per read.

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.
                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
