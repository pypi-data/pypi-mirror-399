Description:  Summarizes monthly contam files into a single file.
This is for internal JGI use.

Usage:  summarizecontam.sh <input files> out=<output file>

Parameters:
in=<file,file>  Input contam summary files, comma-delimited.
                Alternately, file arguments (from a * expansion) will be 
                considered input files.
out=<file>      Output.
tree=auto       Taxtree file location (optional).
overwrite=t     (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than
                overwrite an existing file.

Filter Parameters (passing all required to pass):
minreads=0      Ignore records with fewer reads than this.
minsequnits=0   Ignore records with fewer seq units than this.

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will
                specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
