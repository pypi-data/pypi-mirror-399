Description:  Generates multiple assemblies with Tadpole
to estimate the optimal kmer length.

Usage:
tadwrapper.sh in=reads.fq out=contigs%.fa k=31,62,93

Parameters:
out=<file>      Output file name.  Must contain a % symbol.
outfinal=<file> Optional.  If set, the best assembly file
                will be renamed to this.
k=31            Comma-delimited list of kmer lengths.
delete=f        Delete assemblies before terminating.
quitearly=f     Quit once metrics stop improving with longer kmers.
bisect=f        Recursively assemble with the kmer midway between
                the two best kmers until improvement halts.
expand=f        Recursively assemble with kmers shorter or longer
                than the current best until improvement halts.

All other parameters are passed to Tadpole.
