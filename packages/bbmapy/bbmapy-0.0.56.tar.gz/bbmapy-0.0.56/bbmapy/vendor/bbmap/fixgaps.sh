Description:  Uses paired read insert sizes to estimate the correct
length of scaffold gaps, and resizes incorrectly-sized gaps.

Usage:  fixgaps.sh in=mapped.sam ref=scaffolds.fa out=fixed.fa

Standard parameters:
in=<file>       Reads mapped to the reference; should be sam or bam.
ref=<file>      Reference; may be fasta or fastq.
out=<file>      Modified reference; may be fasta or fastq.
overwrite=f     (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than
                overwrite an existing file.

Processing parameters:
gap=10          Consider any consecutive streak of Ns at least this long to
                be a scaffold break.  Gaps will not be resized to less than
                this.
border=0.4      Ignore the outermost (border*readlen) of an insert (read pair)
                when incrementing coverage.  A higher value is more accurate 
                but requires more coverage and/or longer inserts.  Range: 0-1.
mindepth=10     Minimum spanning read pairs to correct a gap.

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will
                specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
