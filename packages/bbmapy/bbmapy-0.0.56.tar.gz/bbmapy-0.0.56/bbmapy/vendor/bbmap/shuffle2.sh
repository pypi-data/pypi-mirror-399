Description:  Reorders reads randomly, keeping pairs together.
Unlike Shuffle, Shuffle2 can write temp files to handle large datasets.

Usage:  shuffle2.sh in=<file> out=<file>

Standard parameters:
in=<file>       The 'in=' flag is needed if the input file is not the first parameter.  'in=stdin' will pipe from standard in.
in2=<file>      Use this if 2nd read of pairs are in a different file.
out=<file>      The 'out=' flag is needed if the output file is not the second parameter.  'out=stdout' will pipe to standard out.
out2=<file>     Use this to write 2nd read of pairs to a different file.
overwrite=t     (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than overwrite an existing file.
ziplevel=2      (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change compression level; lower compression is faster.
int=auto        (interleaved) Set to t or f to override interleaving autodetection.

Processing parameters:
shuffle         Randomly reorders reads (default).
seed=-1         Set to a positive number for deterministic shuffling.

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.
                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
