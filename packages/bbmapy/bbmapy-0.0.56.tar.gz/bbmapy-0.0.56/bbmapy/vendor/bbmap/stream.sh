Description:  Converts between sam, bam, fasta, fastq.
              Supports subsampling, paired files, and multithreading.

Usage:  stream.sh in=<file> out=<file> <other arguments>
or
stream.sh <input_file> <output_file> <other arguments>
e.g.
stream.sh mapped.bam mapped.sam.gz
stream.sh in=reads.fq out=subset.fq samplerate=0.1

File parameters:
in=<file>       Primary input file, type detected from extension.
in2=<file>      Secondary input file for paired reads.
out=<file>      Primary output file, optional, type based on extension.
out2=<file>     Secondary output file for paired reads.
                Note: Use # symbol for auto-numbering, e.g. reads_#.fq

Processing parameters:
samplerate=1.0  Fraction of reads to keep (0.0 to 1.0).
sampleseed=17   Random seed for subsampling (-1 for random).
reads=-1        Quit after processing this many reads (-1 = all).
ordered=t       Maintain input order in output.

Threading parameters:
threadsin=-1    Reader threads (-1 = auto).
threadsout=-1   Writer threads (-1 = auto).

Other parameters:
simd            Add this flag for turbo speed. Requires Java 17+ and AVX2,
                or other 256-bit vector instruction sets.
