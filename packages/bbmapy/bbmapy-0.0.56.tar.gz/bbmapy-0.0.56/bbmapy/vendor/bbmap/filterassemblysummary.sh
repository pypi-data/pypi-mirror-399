Description:   Filters NCBI assembly summaries according to their taxonomy.
The specific files are available here:

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ASSEMBLY_REPORTS/assembly_summary_genbank.txt
or ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/assembly_summary_genbank.txt
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ASSEMBLY_REPORTS/assembly_summary_refseq.txt
or ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/assembly_summary_refseq.txt

Usage:  filterassemblysummary.sh in=<input file> out=<output file> tree=<tree file> table=<table file> ids=<numbers> level=<name or number>

Standard parameters:
in=<file>       Primary input.
out=<file>      Primary output.
overwrite=f     (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than
                overwrite an existing file.

Processing parameters:
level=          Taxonomic level, such as phylum.  Filtering will operate on
                sequences within the same taxonomic level as specified ids.
reqlevel=       Require nodes to have ancestors at these levels.  For example,
                reqlevel=species,genus would ban nodes that are not defined
                at both the species and genus levels.
ids=            Comma-delimited list of NCBI numeric IDs.
names=          Alternately, a list of names (such as 'Homo sapiens').
                Note that spaces need special handling.
include=f       'f' will discard filtered sequences, 't' will keep them.
tree=           A taxonomic tree made by TaxTree, such as tree.taxtree.gz.
table=          A table translating gi numbers to NCBI taxIDs.
                Only needed if gi numbers will be used.
* Note *
Tree and table files are in /global/projectb/sandbox/gaag/bbtools/tax
For non-Genepool users, or to make new ones, use taxtree.sh and gitable.sh

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will
                specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
