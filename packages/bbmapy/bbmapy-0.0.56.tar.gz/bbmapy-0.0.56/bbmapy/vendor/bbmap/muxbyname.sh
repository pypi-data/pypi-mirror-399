Description:  Multiplexes reads from multiple files after renaming them based on their initial file.
Opposite of demuxbyname.

Usage:  muxbyname.sh in=<file,file,file...> out=<output file>
Input files may also be given without an in= prefix, so that you can use wildcards:
muxbyname.sh *.fastq out=muxed.fastq


Standard parameters:
in=<file,file>  A list of input files.
in2=<file,file> Read 2 input if reads are in paired files.
out=<file>      Primary output, or read 1 output.
out2=<file>     Read 2 output if reads are in paired files.
overwrite=f     (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than
                overwrite an existing file.
showspeed=t     (ss) Set to 'f' to suppress display of processing speed.
ziplevel=2      (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change compression
                level; lower compression is faster.

Processing parameters:
None yet!

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will
                specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
