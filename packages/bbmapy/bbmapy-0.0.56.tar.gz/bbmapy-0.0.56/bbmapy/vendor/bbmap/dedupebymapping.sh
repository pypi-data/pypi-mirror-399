Description:  Deduplicates mapped reads based on pair mapping coordinates.

Usage:   dedupebymapping.sh in=<file> out=<file>

Parameters:
in=<file>           The 'in=' flag is needed if the input file is not the
                    first parameter.  'in=stdin' will pipe from standard in.
out=<file>          The 'out=' flag is needed if the output file is not the
                    second parameter.  'out=stdout' will pipe to standard out.
overwrite=t         (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather
                    than overwrite an existing file.
ziplevel=2          (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change
                    compression level; lower compression is faster.
keepunmapped=t      (ku) Keep unmapped reads.  This refers to unmapped
                    single-ended reads or pairs with both unmapped.
keepsingletons=t    (ks) Keep all pairs in which only one read mapped.  If
                    false, duplicate singletons will be discarded.
ignorepairorder=f   (ipo) If true, consider reverse-complementary pairs
                    as duplicates.

Java Parameters:
-Xmx                This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                    -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.
                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom               This flag will cause the process to exit if an
                    out-of-memory exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da                 Disable assertions.
