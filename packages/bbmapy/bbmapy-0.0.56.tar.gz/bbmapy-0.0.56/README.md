# bbmapy

A Python wrapper for BBTools.
Current version of bbmapy is v39.59.

## Installation

```bash
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge bbmapy # not yet available on conda-forge
```  
Also available on pip (but does not ensure java is available):
```bash
pip install bbmapy
```

## Usage

bbmapy let's you call bbtools stuff from python. To the shell only one CLI is available:  
- `bbmapy-test`: Run tests to verify installation

### Example

```python
from bbmapy import bbmap

# Run bbmap.sh
bbmap.bbmap(
    in1="reads1.fastq",
    in2="reads2.fastq",
    out="mapped.sam",
    ref="reference.fasta"
)
```

## Dependencies

- Python >= 3.9
- rich
- install-jdk (this will be used to install a JRE if needed)

## Usage

After installation, you can use bbmapy in your Python scripts like this:

```python
from bbmapy import bbduk

# Basic usage
bbduk(
    in_file="input.fastq",
    out="output.fastq",
    ktrim="r",
    k="23",
    mink="11",
    hdist="1",
    tbo=True,
    tpe=True,
    minlen="45",
    ref="adapters",
    ftm="5",
    maq="6",
    maxns="1",
    ordered=True,
    threads="4",
    overwrite="t",
    stats="stats.txt"
)
```
### Using Java flags alongside other arguments
```python
bbduk(
    Xmx="2g",  # Set maximum heap size
    da=True,   # Enable assertions
    eoom=True, # Enable out-of-memory termination
    in_file="input.fastq",
    out="output.fastq",
    ktrim="r",
    k="23"
)
```

### To capture output
You need to set `capture_output=True` in the function call, AND out="stdout.fastq" (or any other file format you like). 
```python
stdout, stderr = bbduk(
    capture_output=True,
    Xmx="2g",
    in_file="input.fastq",
    out="stdout.fastq",
    # ... other parameters ...
)
```

#### Getting java executable
Can be a pain, see [this PR discussion](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/29085).  
bioconda's recipes that require java will usually bring a really bloated set of stuff. not good. way too much useless bandwidth (I see no reason that getting bbmap would require alsa).  
But pip and bioconda recipies allow using other pip and conda recipes. Good. A workaround - adding a custom function that recognizes the os + arch and fetches during install or test.  
Technically - this does not count as preloading a binary/executable. The actual JRE is tiny, and getting it can be done via [`install-jdk`](https://pypi.org/project/install-jdk/).  

tl;dr: after installing from pypi (via pip/uv/pixi)
```
bbmapy-ensure-java
```  


#### Notes:
 * `in` can be a protected word in python and other code, it is replaced by `in_file` in function calls. `in1`, `in2` are still valid.
 * Java flags (such as `Xmx`, `Xms`, `da`, `ea`, `eoom`) are automatically recognized and handled appropriately. Include them in your function calls just like any other argument.
 * the `capture_output` argument might be switched (stderr --> out and vice verse). 
 * Flags (i.e. argument that do not take value in the OG bbmap version) are set with Boolean values. e.g.:
 ``` 
 flag : True
 ```
 Not to be mistaken for lower case, fouble qouted `"true"` and `"false"` for boolian arguments to be passed to bbtools, e.g.:
 ```
 argument : "true"
 ```

### to build and upload to pypi

```bash
rm -rf dist build egg-info
pixi run python bbmapy/update.py # fetch latest version of bbtools and update version in pyproject.toml
rm bbmapy/vendor/bbmap/pytools -rf # remove the pytools folder
pixi run pip install --upgrade build twine
pixi run python -m build
pixi run twine upload dist/*

```
