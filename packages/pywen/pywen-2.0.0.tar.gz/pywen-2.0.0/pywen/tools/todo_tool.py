DESCRIPTION = """
Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. 
This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user. 
It also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.

  ## When to Use This Tool
  Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:

  1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps
     or actions
  2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or
     multiple operations
  3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to
     use the todo list
  4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be
     done (numbered or comma-separated)
  5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements
     as todos
  6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning
     work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time
  7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up
     tasks discovered during implementation

  ## When NOT to Use This Tool

  Skip using this tool when:
  1. There is only a single, straightforward task
  2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
  3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
  4. The task is purely conversational or informational

  NOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to
  do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.

  ## Examples of When to Use the Todo List

  <example>
  User: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure
  you run the tests and build when you're done!
  Assistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let
  me create a todo list to track this implementation.
  *Creates todo list with the following items:*
  1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page
  2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)
  3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme
  4. Update existing components to support theme switching
  5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur
  *Begins working on the first task*

  <reasoning>
  The assistant used the todo list because:
  1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management,
     and styling changes
  2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward
  3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding "Ensure
     tests and build succeed" as the final task
  </reasoning>
  </example>

  <example>
  User: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across
  my project
  Assistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences
  of 'getCwd'.
  *Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*
  Assistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let
  me create a todo list to track these changes.
  *Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*

  <reasoning>
  The assistant used the todo list because:
  1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task
  2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined
     this was a complex task with multiple steps
  3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated
     systematically
  4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code
     consistency
  </reasoning>
  </example>

  <example>
  User: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user
  registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.
  Assistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the
  features to the todo list.
  *Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on
  the project architecture*
  Assistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating
  database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your
  existing authentication system.

  <reasoning>
  The assistant used the todo list because:
  1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma
     separated list
  2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks
  3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire
     implementation
  </reasoning>
  </example>

  <example>
  User: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and
  has performance issues.</user>
  Assistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine
  your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.
  *Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data
  fetching*
  Assistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance
  issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.
  *Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implement memoization for expensive
  calculations in ProductList, 2) Add virtualization for long lists in
  Dashboard, 3) Optimize image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fix state
  update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Review bundle size and implement code
  splitting*
  Let's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your
  ProductList component.</assistant>

  <reasoning>
  The assistant used the todo list because:
  1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific
     performance issues
  2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities
  3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps
  4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different
     components
  5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed
  </reasoning>
  </example>

  ## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List

  <example>
  User: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?
  Assistant: In Python, you can print "Hello World" with this simple code:

  python
  print("Hello World")

  This will output the text "Hello World" to the console when executed.
  </assistant>

  <reasoning>
  The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial
  task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple
  tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.
  </reasoning>
  </example>

  <example>
  User: What does the git status command do?
  Assistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working
  directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which
  haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental
  command for understanding the current state of your repository before making
  commits.

  <reasoning>
  The assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational
  request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for
  an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.
  </reasoning>
  </example>

  <example>
  User: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it
  does?
  Assistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to
  explain what it does.
  * Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *

  <reasoning>
  The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single,
  straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment
  doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.
  </reasoning>
  </example>

  <example>
  User: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.
  Assistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.

  *Executes: npm install*

  The command completed successfully. Here's the output:
  [Output of npm install command]

  All dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.

  <reasoning>
  The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command
  execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or
  organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.
  </reasoning>
  </example>

  ## Task States and Management

  1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:
     - pending: Task not yet started
     - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
     - completed: Task finished successfully

  2. **Task Management**:
     - Update task status in real-time as you work
     - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch
       completions)
     - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time
     - Complete current tasks before starting new ones
     - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely

  3. **Task Completion Requirements**:
     - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it
     - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as
       in_progress
     - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved
     - Never mark a task as completed if:
       - Tests are failing
       - Implementation is partial
       - You encountered unresolved errors
       - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies

  4. **Task Breakdown**:
     - Create specific, actionable items
     - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
     - Use clear, descriptive task names

  When in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management
  demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements
  successfully.
