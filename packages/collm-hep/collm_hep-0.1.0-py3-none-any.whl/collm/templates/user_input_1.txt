[SELECTION_CUTS]
- Select electrons with pT > 10 GeV and |eta| < 2.5
- Select muons with pT > 10 GeV and |eta| < 2.4
- Requires at least two leptons
- Requires at least two taus  
- Requires at least two b  jets
- Select invariant mass of the leading and second leading leptons between 10 and 300
- Select angular separation between the leading tau and second leading b jet > 0.1 

[PLOTS_FOR_VALIDATION]
- Plot the following with all plots are histograms:
1 Plot the leading electron and subleading muon pT superimposed. Use different opacity for better visualization.
2 Plot the missing energy distribution
3 Plot the transverse momentum of the leading b jet
4 Plot the eta of b jets
5 plot the invariant mass of the leading and subleading  taus
6 Plot the pT of the b jets
7 Plot invariant mass of the leading and subleading b jets in the mass range between 10 and 150
8 Plot invariant mass of the leading and subleading lepton in the mass range between 10 and 150
9 Plot delta R between leading electron and subleading b jet
10 delta eta between the leading and subleading b jets

- Each histogram is required to have 50 bins.
- Write the title of the figures in symbols or LaTeX if applicable.
- Normalize all the histograms to one.


[OUTPUT_STRUCTURE]
- print summary statistics and print the number of events before and after the selection cuts
- save the following  in a single  csv file for MLP analysis:
  1- pt of the leading letpton
  2- pt of the leading tau leptons
  3- delta R between the leading lepton and leading tau
  4- delta eta between the leading and subleading b jets
