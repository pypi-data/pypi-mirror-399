[SELECTION_CUTS]
- Select electrons with pT > 10 GeV and |eta| < 2.5
- Select muons with pT > 10 GeV and |eta| < 2.4
- Select the leading muon with pt > 40  and the leading electron with pt > 50
- select delta R between leading electorn and subleading electron > 0.1
- requires at least two leptons
- requires at least two  jets
- select invariant mass of the leading and second leading leptons beween 10 and  200

[PLOTS_FOR_VALIDATION]
- All plots are histograms and in a signle figure. 
- plot the leading electron and subleading muon superimposed. use different opessity for better visualization. 
- Plot the missing energy distribution 
- Plot the transverse momentum of the leading  jet
- plot the eta of  jets
- plot the pT of the ligth jets
- plot invariant mass of the leading and subleading jets in the mass range between 10 and 150
- plot invariant mass of the leading and subleading lepton in the mass range between 10 and 150
- plot delta R between leading electorn and subleading electron
 Each histogram is requried a 50 bins.
 Write the title of the figures in symbols or latex if aplicaple 
 Normalize all the histograms to one. 


[OUTPUT_STRUCTURE]
- Enforce the Printing of the number of events after each selection cut
