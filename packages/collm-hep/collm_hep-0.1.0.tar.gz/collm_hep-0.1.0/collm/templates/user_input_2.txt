# ==============================================================

[SELECTION_CUTS]
- Select electrons with pT > 10 GeV and |eta| < 2.5
- Select muons with pT > 10 GeV and |eta| < 2.4
- Requires at least two leptons
- Requires at least two taus  
- Requires at least two b jets
 

[PLOTS_FOR_VALIDATION]

- Plot histogram invariant mass of the leading and subleading taus
- plot histogram pt of the leading tau and subleading  tau superimposed of each other. Use different opacity for better visualization
- plot histogram pt of the leading and subleading  b jet superimposed. Use different opacity for better visualization
- Plot histogram invariant mass of the leading and subleading lepton 
- Plot histogram delta R between leading electron and subleading b jet
- Plot histogram delta eta between the leading and subleading b jets

- Save the histograms in png format
- Each histogram is required to have 50 bins.
- Write the title of the figures in symbols or LaTeX if applicable.
- Normalize each histogram to one

[OUTPUT_STRUCTURE]
- print summary statistics and print the number of events before and after the selection cuts
