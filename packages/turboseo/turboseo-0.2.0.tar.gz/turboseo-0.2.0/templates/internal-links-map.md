## Top Blog Posts

High-performing content to link to:

| Post | URL | Topic Cluster |
|------|-----|---------------|
| [Post Title] | /blog/slug | [cluster] |
| [Post Title] | /blog/slug | [cluster] |

## Topic Clusters

Organize content by topic cluster for strategic linking:

### [Cluster 1: e.g., "Getting Started"]
- Pillar: /guides/getting-started
- Related:
  - /blog/first-steps → links to pillar
  - /blog/common-mistakes → links to pillar
  - /blog/quick-wins → links to pillar

### [Cluster 2: e.g., "Advanced Topics"]
- Pillar: /guides/advanced
- Related:
  - /blog/advanced-tip-1
  - /blog/advanced-tip-2

## Anchor Text Guidelines

### Preferred Anchor Text
For each key page, list preferred anchor text variations:

| Page | Anchor Text Options |
|------|-------------------|
| /products/main | "our product", "[Product Name]", "the solution" |
| /guides/start | "getting started guide", "beginner's guide", "learn how" |

### Avoid
- "Click here"
- "Read more"
- "This article"
- Exact-match keywords repeatedly
