# How to Actually Make Money From Your Podcast

Most podcasters never make a dime. Here's how to be in the minority that does.

## The Math Behind Podcast Money

Let's start with reality: you need at least 1,000 downloads per episode before most sponsors will talk to you. At that level, expect $15-25 per 1,000 downloads (CPM) for a mid-roll ad.

Do the math: 1,000 downloads × $20 CPM = $20 per episode.

That's why smart podcasters don't rely on ads alone.

## Three Revenue Streams That Work

### 1. Premium Content

Offer bonus episodes or early access for $5/month. If 2% of your listeners subscribe, that's more predictable than chasing sponsors.

### 2. Services and Products

Use your podcast as a funnel. A B2B podcast with 500 listeners can generate more revenue than a comedy show with 50,000 if those 500 are decision-makers who hire you.

### 3. Affiliate Deals

Promote tools you actually use. Podcast hosting, microphones, editing software—if you'd recommend it anyway, get paid for it.

## What Most Guides Won't Tell You

The podcasters making real money aren't the ones with the most downloads. They're the ones who picked a specific audience and solved their problems.

Stop chasing download numbers. Start asking: "Who listens to my show, and what do they need?"
