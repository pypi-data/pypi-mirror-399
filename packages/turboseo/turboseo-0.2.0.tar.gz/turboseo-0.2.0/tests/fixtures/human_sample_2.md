# Setting Up Your First Podcast Studio (Without Going Broke)

You don't need a professional studio to start a podcast. Here's what actually matters—and what doesn't.

## The Only Equipment That Matters

### Microphone: $60-100

The Audio-Technica ATR2100x or Samson Q2U are both USB mics that sound great. Don't spend more until you've recorded 20+ episodes.

### Headphones: $20-50

Any closed-back headphones work. The Sony MDR-7506 is the industry standard, but even Apple earbuds work in a pinch.

### Recording Space: $0

Your closet. Seriously. Clothes absorb sound better than foam panels. Record in there.

## Software Setup

Audacity is free and does everything you need. Descript is $12/month if you want easier editing.

Don't buy Pro Tools. Don't buy a Shure SM7B. Don't buy a GoXLR.

Not yet.

## The Setup That Actually Sounds Good

1. Put your mic 4-6 inches from your mouth
2. Talk across the mic, not into it
3. Record in a quiet room with soft surfaces
4. Use a pop filter (or a sock over the mic—yes, really)

That's it. Everything else is optimization for later.

## Common Mistakes

- Buying expensive gear before learning to use cheap gear
- Recording in echoey rooms
- Sitting too far from the mic
- Over-processing audio in post

Get the basics right first. Upgrade when you hit a wall, not before.
