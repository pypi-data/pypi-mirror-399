        k
            Number of (unconstrained) bases.
        basis_degree
            Degree of the polynomials used in the B-spline basis function. Default is 3
            for cubic B-splines.
        penalty_order
            Order of the penalty.
        knots
            Knots used to set up the basis. If ``None`` (default), a set of equidistant
            knots will be set up automatically, with the domain boundaries inferred from
            the minimum and maximum of the observed values. The number of knots must be

        diagonal_penalty
            Whether the penalty matrix associated with this term should be
            reparameterized into a diagonal matrix. In this case, the basis matrix is
            reparameterized accordingly. This can be beneficial for posterior geometry,

        scale_penalty
            Whether the penalty matrix should be scaled such that its infinity norm is
            one. This can improve numerical stability, which is why it is done by
            default. Also see :meth:`.Basis.scale_penalty`.
        basis_name
            Function-name for the basis matrix. If ``"B"``, and the basis is a function

        Cyclic cubic regression spline basis and penalty matrix.

        Basis for  a penalized cubic regression spline whose ends match, up to second
        derivative.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x
            Name of input variable.
        k
            Number of (unconstrained) bases.
        penalty_order
            Order of the penalty.
        knots
            Knots used to set up the basis. If ``None`` (default), a set of equidistant
            knots will be set up automatically, with the domain boundaries inferred from
            the minimum and maximum of the observed values.
        absorb_cons
            Whether the default identification constraint should be applied by
            reparameterization and absorbing the reparameterization matrix into the
            basis and penalty matrices for computational efficiency. If ``False``, the
            basis is unconstrained, if ``True`` it receives a sum to zero constrained.
            Also see :meth:`.Basis.constrain`.
        diagonal_penalty
            Whether the penalty matrix associated with this term should be
            reparameterized into a diagonal matrix. In this case, the basis matrix is
            reparameterized accordingly. This can be beneficial for posterior geometry,
            which is why it is the default. Also see :meth:`.Basis.diagonalize_penalty`.
        scale_penalty
            Whether the penalty matrix should be scaled such that its infinity norm is
            one. This can improve numerical stability, which is why it is done by
            default. Also see :meth:`.Basis.scale_penalty`.
        basis_name
            Function-name for the basis matrix. If ``"B"``, and the basis is a function
            of the variable ``"x"``, the full name of the :class:`.Basis` object will be
            ``"B(x)"``. Names are made unique by appending a counter if necessary.

        Notes
        -----

        This basis is initialized with ``use_callback=True`` and ``cache_basis=True``.
        See :class:`.Basis` for details.

        Cyclicity is enforced by matching the function and its derivatives at the domain
        boundaries. This method internally calls the R package mgcv to set up the basis
        and penalty. The mgcv documentation provides further details.

        absorb_cons
            Whether the default identification constraint should be applied by
            reparameterization and absorbing the reparameterization matrix into the
            basis and penalty matrices for computational efficiency. If ``False``, the
            basis is unconstrained, if ``True`` it receives a sum to zero constrained.
            Also see :meth:`.Basis.constrain`.
        diagonal_penalty
            Whether the penalty matrix associated with this term should be
            reparameterized into a diagonal matrix. In this case, the basis matrix is
            reparameterized accordingly. This can be beneficial for posterior geometry,
            which is why it is the default. Also see :meth:`.Basis.diagonalize_penalty`.
        scale_penalty
            Whether the penalty matrix should be scaled such that its infinity norm is
            one. This can improve numerical stability, which is why it is done by
            default. Also see :meth:`.Basis.scale_penalty`.
        basis_name
            Function-name for the basis matrix. If ``"B"``, and the basis is a function
            of the variable ``"x"``, the full name of the :class:`.Basis` object will be
            ``"B(x)"``. Names are made unique by appending a counter if necessary.
        remove_null_space_completely
            If ``True``, the unpenalized part of the smooth, corresponding to the null
            space of the penalty matrix, is removed completely.

        Notes
        -----

        This basis is initialized with ``use_callback=True`` and ``cache_basis=True``.
        See :class:`.Basis` for details.

        This method internally calls the R package mgcv to set up the basis and penalty.
        The mgcv documentation provides further details.

        formula
            Right-hand side of a model formula, as understood by formulaic_. Most of

        xname
            If provided, the design matrix will be named ``{basis_name}({xname})``, for
            example ``B(x)``, is ``basis_name="B"`` and ``xname="x"``.
        basis_name
            Name of the basis variable.
        include_intercept
            Whether to include an intercept column in the basis.
        context
            Dictionary of additional Python objects that should be made available to
            formulaic when constructing the design matrix. Gets passed to
            ``formulaic.ModelSpec.get_model_matrix()``.

        Notes
        -----

        The following formulaic syntax is supported:

        - ``+`` for adding a term
        - ``a:b`` for simple interactions
        - ``a*b`` for expanding to ``a + b + a:b``
        - ``(a + b)**n`` for n-th order interactions
        - ``a / b`` for nesting
        - ``C(a, ...)`` for categorical effects
        - ``b %in% a`` for inverted nesting
        - ``{a+1}`` for quoted Python code to be executed
        - ```weird name``` backtick-strings for weird names
        - Other transformations like ``center(a)``, ``scale(a)``, or ``lag(a)``, see
          grammar_.
        - Python functions

        Not supported:

        - String literals
        - Numeric literals
        - Wildcard ``"."``
        - ``\\|`` for splitting a formula
        - ``"~"`` in formula, since this method supports only the right-hand side of a
          Wilkinson formula.
        - ``1 +``, ``0 +``, or ``-1`` in formula, since intercept addition is handled
          via the argument ``include_intercept``.

        Random intercept basis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cluster
            Name of the cluster variable.
        basis_name
            Name of the basis variable.
        penalty
            Custom penalty matrix to use. Default is an iid penalty.

        Notes
        ------
        If the penalty is iid, then each column of the basis consists only of binary
        (0/1) entries, and each row has only one non-zero entry. In this case it is not
        necessary to store the full matrix in memory and evaluate the term as a dot
        product ``basis @ coef``.

        Instead, we can simply store a 1d array of indices, identifying the nonzero
        column for each row of the basis matrix, and use this index to access the
        corresponding coefficient. This scenario is common for independent random
        intercepts.

        This method returns such a sparse representation of the random intercept
        basis if ``penalty=None``.

        Gaussian Markov random field basis and penalty.

        The preferred way to initialize these is by supplying ``polys``, because this
        enables plotting via :func:`.plot_regions`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x
            Name of the region variable.
        k
            If ``-1``, this is a "full-rank" (up to identifiability constraint) Markov
            random field. If ``k`` is an integer smaller than the number of unique
            regions, a low-rank field will be returned, see Wood (2017), Sections 5.8.1
            and 5.4.2.
        polys
            Dictionary of arrays. The keys of the dict are the region labels. The
            corresponding values define the region by defining polygons. The
            neighborhood structure can be inferred from this polygon information.
        nb
            Dictionary of array. The keys of the dict are the region labels. The
            corresponding values indicate the neighbors of the region. If the values are
            lists or arrays of strings, the values are the labels of the neighbors. If
            they are lists or arrays of integers, the values are the indices of the
            neighbors. Indices correspond to regions based on an alphabetical ordering
            of regions.
        penalty
            If a penalty is supplied explicitly, it takes precedence over a potential
            penalty derived from both nb and polys.
        penalty_labels
            If a penalty is supplied explicitly, labels must also be specified. The
            labels create the association between penalty columns and region labels. The
            values of this sequence should be the string labels of unique regions in
            ``x``.
        absorb_cons
            Whether the default identification constraint should be applied by
            reparameterization and absorbing the reparameterization matrix into the
            basis and penalty matrices for computational efficiency. If ``False``, the
            basis is unconstrained, if ``True`` it receives a sum to zero constrained.
            Also see :meth:`.Basis.constrain`.
        diagonal_penalty
            Whether the penalty matrix associated with this term should be
            reparameterized into a diagonal matrix. In this case, the basis matrix is
            reparameterized accordingly. This can be beneficial for posterior geometry,
            which is why it is the default. Also see :meth:`.Basis.diagonalize_penalty`.
        scale_penalty
            Whether the penalty matrix should be scaled such that its infinity norm is
            one. This can improve numerical stability, which is why it is done by
            default. Also see :meth:`.Basis.scale_penalty`.
        basis_name
            Function-name for the basis matrix. If ``"B"``, and the basis is a function
            of the variable ``"x"``, the full name of the :class:`.Basis` object will be
            ``"B(x)"``. Names are made unique by appending a counter if necessary.

        Notes
        -----

        This basis is initialized with ``use_callback=True`` and ``cache_basis=True``.
        See :class:`.Basis` for details.

        This method internally calls the R package mgcv to set up the basis and penalty.
        The mgcv documentation provides further details.

        Returns
        -------

            Comments on the :class:`.MRFSpec` attached to the returned
            :class:`.MRFBasis` variable:

            - If either polys or nb are supplied, the returned MRFSpec will contain
              nb.
            - If only a penalty matrix is supplied, the returned MRFSpec will *not*
              contain nb.
            - Returning the label order only makes sense if the basis is *not*
              reparameterized, because only then we have a clear correspondence of
              parameters to labels. If the basis is reparameterized, with
              ``absorb_cons=True`` or of low rank with ``k ≠ -1``, there is no such
              correspondence in a clear way, so the label order is None.


        Examples
        --------
        >>> import liesel_gam as gam
        >>> df = gam.demo_data(n=100)

        ['a' 'b' 'c']

        >>> bb.mrf("x_cat", nb=nb)
        MRFBasis(name="B(x_cat)")
