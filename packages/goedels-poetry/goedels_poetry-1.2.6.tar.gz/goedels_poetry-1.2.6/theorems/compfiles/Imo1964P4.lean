# International Mathematical Olympiad 1964, Problem 4

Seventeen people correspond by mail with one another -- each one with
all the rest. In their letters only three different topics are
discussed. Each pair of correspondents deals with only one of the topics.
Prove that there are at least three people who write to each other
about the same topic.
