The previous proof sketch (Round {{ prev_round_num }}) was syntactically valid, but the decomposed subgoals could not be proven after multiple attempts. This suggests that the decomposition strategy itself may not be the right approach for this theorem.

Please try a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT decomposition strategy. Consider:
- A different proof technique (e.g., if the previous attempt used induction, try direct proof, contradiction, or case analysis)
- A different way to break down the problem into subgoals
- Different intermediate lemmas that might be easier to prove
- A simpler or more direct path to the conclusion
- Utilizing, if warranted, the possibly new theorems listed below in pursuit of your goal

Before producing the new Lean 4 code to sketch a proof, provide:
1. A brief analysis of why the previous decomposition might have been too difficult
2. A description of the new strategy you will try
3. An explanation of how this new approach differs from the previous one

Note that the theorems listed below may differ from those presented in previous attempts, as a new search strategy was used to find potentially useful theorems for this different decomposition approach. These theorems may or may not be new compared to previous attempts, but they represent theorems identified specifically for trying this alternative strategy. Consider how these theorems might be useful in your new decomposition approach.
