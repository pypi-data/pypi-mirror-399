/** @mainpage GridGain C++ client
GridGain is a distributed database and computing platform designed for high-performance, in-memory data processing.<br>
It combines in-memory data storage with powerful computing capabilities, enabling real-time analytics, transactional processing, and hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP) at scale.<br>
GridGain supports SQL, key-value, and ACID-compliant transactions, and can be used as a caching layer, a persistent database, or a compute grid across clusters.<br>
<br>
The C++ client for GridGain allows C++ applications to connect to a GridGain cluster and interact with it remotely.<br>
It provides APIs for performing cache operations, executing SQL queries and compute jobs.<br>
The client communicates with the cluster over a binary protocol, enabling high-performance, low-latency access to GridGain's in-memory data and services.<br>
