"""
test_pipeline_order_v36.py - Amanah-first hard floor behavior in pipeline.

This test ensures that a pure Amanah hard floor failure in stage_888_judge
produces a VOID verdict even when all other core floors pass. If future
changes weaken Amanah or treat it as non-fatal, this test will fail and
signal a violation of the Amanah-first repair order described in CLAUDE.md.
