# a recipe the current path of all sources is searched to find that named recipe.

# vendors can define/provide their own

# Passes SII 672.4nm and H-Beta 486.1nm lines
# Capturing of the two main emission wavebands in the deep red and blue at the same time
#
# The ALP-T dual band 3.5nm SII&Hb filter is a dual narrowband filter, which lets the deep
# red Sulfur-II 672.4nm and the blue Hydrogen-Beta 486.1nm lines through and is primarily
# engineered for color cameras to assist astrophotographers taking deep sky images with
# superior SNR(Signal to Noise Ratio). With an FWHM halfbandwidth designed at 3.5nm and
# achieving an optical density (OD) of 4.5 on unwanted wavelengths, it works strongly in
# blocking light pollution, moonlight, and airglow, leding to enhanced contrast in nebulae
# images by effectively passing the SII and H-beta emission lines signal only.

# List the initial search path to find other repos, when the app launches it always first loads this sb.toml file and this file should list all of the
# standard default repo locations.  When searching repos, repos listed LAST have precedence, so target file can override the root processing defaults,
# then the user prefs, then a live github URL or whatever
