A tool for automating/standardizing/sharing astrophotography workflows.

## What is starbash?

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geeksville/starbash/refs/heads/main/doc/img/icon.jpg" alt="Starbash: Astrophotography workflows simplified" width="30%" align="right" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">

* Automatic - with sensible defaults that you can change as needed.  Just a few keystrokes to preprocess an entire repo of raw images.
* Easy - provides a 'seestar-like' autoprocessing all your sessions (by default).  You can optionally do manual postprocessing with all this 'grunt work' preprocessing automated.
* Fast<sup>1</sup> - even with large image repositories.  Automatic master bias and flat generation.  Automatic preprocessing/ stacking/background-elimination with reasonable defaults.
* Multi-session - by default.  So your workflows can stack from multiple nights (and still use the correct flats etc...).
* Shareable - you can share/use recipes for image preprocessing flows.  The eventual goal is a transition away from opaque burried scripts.  Recipes can come from multiple repos and you or other orgs can host recipes.
* Attribution (by default) - a full set of contributions to final image can be tracked: instrument, raw images, processed-by, recipes-by/version etc...

(This project is currently 'alpha' and missing recipes for some workflows, but adding new recipes is easy and we're happy to help.  Please file a GitHub issue if your images are not auto-processed and we'll work out a fix.)

<sub>**Caveats:**
1. 'Fast' in terms of you 'just need to click run and magically (ahem) everything just happens.'  But if you ask it to process many images it can take hours - just come back when it is done.</sub>

## What is starbash NOT

### Not a new image processing tool (like Siril)
It is important to understand that Starbash is primarily a tool for **repeatable**, **sharable**, **semi-automated** workflows.  It is tool agnostic and really just focuses on the relationship between tools, images and sessions.  It builds upon the great work of existing tools (currently mainly Siril and Graxpert) so we can grow an ecosystem of recipes.

### Not a set of scripts

It is more a tool for moving away from (sometimes long and complex) opaque scripts.  "Recipes" are kinda like scripts except they are small and atomic and use dependencies to be automatically installed at the appropriate stage of workflows.  But the actual operations performed by a recipe can be for any of the supported tools.

For instance: if you don't like a particular "stack" stage recipe you can swap out just that portion of the workflow for an alternate implementation.  Or make your own and share it with others.  (With full automatic versioning so that workflows hopefully always keep working/evolving)

Starbash understands FITS metadata and how to run tools based on that metadata, but the actual image transformations are entirely up to you and anyone who writes a recipe.

We provide a few example recipes to enable auto-selection of common workflows (see below for example links).  But hopefully others will either add to these recipes or host their own recipe repos.

If you are familar with the software enginering tools "npm, make and git", the goal of this project is to provide an analogous sharable workflows for astrophotography.

# Current status

This project is still very young - but making good progress 😊!

If you are interested in alpha-testing we ❤️ you.  This README should have enough instructions to get you going, but if you encounter **any** problems please file a github issue and we'll work together to fix them.

## Current features

### From the alpha 1 (0.1.0) release (2025/11/12)
* Automatically recognizes and auto-parses the default NINA, Asiair, and Seestar raw file repos (adding support for other layouts is easy).
* Multi-session support by default (including automatic selection of correct flats, biases, and dark frames).
* 'Repos' can contain raw files, generated masters, preprocessed files, or recipes.
* Automatically performs **complete** preprocessing on OSC (broadband, narrowband, or dual Duo filter).  i.e., gives you 'seestar-level' auto-preprocessing, so you only need to do the (optional) custom post-processing.
* Uses Siril recipes for its pre-processing operations (support for Pixinsight-based recipes will probably be coming at some point...).

### From the alpha 2 (0.2.0) release (2025/12/12)
* Include a stretched 'thumbnail'(FIXME/link/example/thumbnail) jpg proof-of-concept render in the output directories
* Generates a per-target [report/config file](doc/toml/example/processed-repo/example-m20.toml) which can be customized if the detected defaults or preprocessing are not what you want.
* '[Recipes](https://github.com/geeksville/starbash-recipes)' are now user-editable - provides repeatable/human-[readable](doc/toml/example/processed-repo/example-m20.toml)/shareable descriptions of all processing steps. [example Siril OSC stacking](https://github.com/geeksville/starbash-recipes/blob/6d255f48591c4991ddc1168ffa5c38050a500771/osc/osc_simple.toml), [example Graxpert BGE](https://github.com/geeksville/starbash-recipes/blob/6d255f48591c4991ddc1168ffa5c38050a500771/graxpert/background.toml), [example thumbnail generation](https://github.com/geeksville/starbash-recipes/blob/6d255f48591c4991ddc1168ffa5c38050a500771/common/thumbnail.toml)...
* Repos can be on the local disk or shared via HTTPS/GitHub/etc.  This is particularly useful for recipe repos.
* [Graxpert](https://graxpert.com/) based [recipe stages](https://github.com/geeksville/starbash-recipes/tree/main/graxpert) added (support for Pixinsight-based recipes will probably be coming at some point...).

## Features coming soon

* Recipe 'writers guide' documentation.  Currently iterating based on usage reports 😄
* Support for mono-camera workflows (the alpha only includes osc recipes).
* The target report can be used to auto-generate a human-friendly 'postable/shareable' report about that image.
* Target reports are shareable so that you can request comments from others and others can rerender with different settings.
* Namespaces for recipes are disambiguated to be globally unique

## Features (possibly) coming eventually

* [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) based sharing of images and the workflows used to build those images (if you wish)
* Nice graph view of raw images, recipes and operations that contributed to a final image.  Also possibly exposed via IPFS.
* Pixinsight?
* Autostakkert?

See the [TODO](TODO.md) file for work items and approximate schedule.

## Support

If you have questions/ideas please post in the [discussion group](https://github.com/geeksville/starbash/discussions).  If you find bugs please create an [issue](https://github.com/geeksville/starbash/issues).  This is a friendly project.

## Installing

Currently the easiest way to install this command-line based tool is via [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/).  If you don't already have pipx and you have Python installed, you can auto-install it by running "pip install --user pipx."  If you don't have Python installed see the pipx link for pipx installers for any OS.

Once pipx is installed just run the following **two** commands (the `sb --install-completion` will make TAB auto-complete automatically complete `sb` options for most platforms).  Installing auto-complete is **highly** recommended because it makes entering starbash commands fast by pressing the TAB key:

```
➜ pipx install starbash
  installed package starbash 0.1.3, installed using Python 3.12.3
  These apps are now globally available
    - sb
    - starbash
done! ✨ 🌟 ✨

➜ sb --install-completion
bash completion installed in /home/.../sb.sh
Completion will take effect once you restart the terminal

```

## Use

### Initial setup

The first time you launch starbash you will be prompted to choose a few options. You will also be told how you can add your existing raw frames and an input repo.

![user setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geeksville/starbash/refs/heads/main/doc/img/user-setup.png)

If you ever want to rerun this setup just run 'sb user setup'

### Automatic stacking/preprocessing

One of the main goals of starbash is to provide 'seestar-like' automatic image preprocessing:
* automatic stacking (even over multiple sessions) - (via Siril)
* automatic recipe selection (color, bw, duo filters etc...), but you can customize if starbash picks poorly
* background removal - (via Graxpert by default) provided as extra (optional) output files
* star removal - (via Starnet by default) provided as extra (optional) output files
* no changes to input repos - you can safely ask starbash to auto-process your entire tree of raw images.  Processed images go in a special 'processed' output repo.

![auto session](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geeksville/starbash/refs/heads/main/doc/vhs/process-auto.gif)

How to use TLDR: just type "**sb process auto**" and it will probably do okay for your first attempt.

Read on for the 'long/complete' instructions:

* Step 1 - **Optional! If you skip this Starbash will default to attempting to process all of your sessions.  Go get a coffee and come back to see how it did 😊** Select some sessions.  Example commands to use (when running commands the tool will provide feedback on what the current session set contains):

```
sb select any # selects all sessions in your repo
sb select # prints information about the current selection
sb select list # lists all sessions in the current selection
sb select date after 2025-09-01
sb select date before 2025-10-01
sb select date between 2025-07-03 2025-10-01

sb select target m31 # select all sessions with m31.
```
Note: Tab completion is supported so if you type select target m<tab>
you should get a list of all the Messier objects you have in your images.
In fact, tab completion works on virtually any starbash option - pressing
tab for dates will show you dates you have image sessions for instance...

* Step 2 - Do auto-process.  This will process all of the sessions you currently have selected.  It will group outputs by target name and it will auto-select flat frames on a per-session-date basis.  At the end of processing a list of targets and their processing will be printed.  Any needed master frames will be generated as well.

```
sb process auto
```

![auto finished](doc/img/auto_finish.png)

The output directory (in addition to the processed fits outputs & jpeg thumbnails) will also contain a 'starbash.toml'.  That file contains information about what choices were made during processing (which masters selected, which recipes selected..., selected Siril options, etc...).

You can edit that file to pick different choices and if you reprocess that target your choices will be used.

### Manual Siril processing

If you don't want the automated processing you can still ask Starbash to prepare a 'siril processing directory' with the appropriate flats, darks, biases and your light frames.  FIXME - add instructions on how to do this.
