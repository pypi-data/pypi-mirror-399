# in future runs.

[about] # (if not present this section will be auto generated at processing time)

# this section contains textual information the user might want to share on social media or whatever
# some of it comes from FITS headers gleaned during processing or other statistics

# target.name = "Some Big Nebula"
# target.ra = "123.45"
# OBJCTRA = '00 23 44'           / [H M S] RA of imaged object

# Information about recipes used for processing or excluded by the user
# If you'd like to pick something different just comment out the line in USED and uncomment the line in
# excluded.
# Whenever stabash is rerun it will update these arrays based on what was actually used for this run.
