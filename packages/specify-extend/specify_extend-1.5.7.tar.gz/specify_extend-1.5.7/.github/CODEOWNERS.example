# CODEOWNERS - Automatic Review Request Configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: This is an EXAMPLE file. Before activating:
# 1. Replace ALL "@your-org/..." placeholders with actual GitHub usernames or team names
# 2. Verify all teams exist in your organization settings
# 3. Test with a draft PR to ensure proper assignment
# 4. Invalid references will cause GitHub to silently ignore CODEOWNERS rules
#
# To activate this file:
# 1. Review and update all placeholder values below
# 2. Rename this file to "CODEOWNERS" (without .example)
# 3. Commit and push to your repository
#
# When a PR modifies files matching these patterns, GitHub will automatically
# request review from the specified users or teams.
#
# Integration with Spec-Kit Workflows:
# - Use this to ensure appropriate reviewers are assigned based on workflow type
# - Combine with spec-kit review enforcement for comprehensive quality control
# - Teams/users will be notified to perform human review after /speckit.review
#
# Syntax:
# pattern @username @org/team-name

# Configuration Examples for Different Team Structures
# ==============================================================================

# Example 1: Solo Developer with AI Agents
# (Review all changes yourself, rely on /speckit.review for AI review)
# *       @yourusername

# Example 2: Small Team (2-5 developers)
# *       @dev1 @dev2 @dev3
# specs/  @dev1    # Lead developer reviews all specs

# Example 3: Medium Team with Specialization
# src/frontend/    @frontend-lead @frontend-team
# src/backend/     @backend-lead @backend-team
# specs/           @tech-lead

# Example 4: Large Team with Multiple Teams
# (See examples above with @your-org/team-name)

# ==============================================================================
# Integration with Spec-Kit Review Workflow
# ==============================================================================

# How CODEOWNERS works with spec-kit review:
#
# 1. Developer completes implementation
# 2. Developer runs: /speckit.review (AI code review)
# 3. Review file generated with findings
# 4. Developer commits review file
# 5. Developer creates PR
# 6. GitHub automatically requests human reviewers (via CODEOWNERS)
# 7. Automated workflow checks for approved review file
# 8. Human reviewers perform additional review
# 9. Both AI review (approved) + human review (approved) required to merge
#
# This creates a comprehensive review process:
# - AI Review (/speckit.review): Fast, consistent, catches common issues
# - Human Review (CODEOWNERS): Context-aware, architectural decisions, UX
# - Automated Enforcement (GitHub Actions): Ensures process is followed

# ==============================================================================
# Customization Instructions
# ==============================================================================

# To use this file:
# 1. Rename: CODEOWNERS.example → CODEOWNERS
# 2. Replace @your-org/team-name with your actual GitHub org and team names
# 3. Replace @username with actual GitHub usernames
# 4. Customize patterns to match your project structure
# 5. Commit to .github/CODEOWNERS
# 6. Enable branch protection requiring reviews
#
# Tips:
# - Start simple, add complexity as needed
# - Use teams rather than individuals for flexibility
# - More specific rules override general rules
# - Use wildcards (*) for pattern matching
# - Test with a draft PR to verify correct reviewers assigned
#
# Advanced: Require different numbers of reviewers
# - Set in: Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules
# - Require X number of approving reviews
# - Dismiss stale reviews when new commits pushed
# - Require review from code owners
