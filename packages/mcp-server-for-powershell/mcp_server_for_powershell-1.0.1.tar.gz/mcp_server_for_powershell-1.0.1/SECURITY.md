## Threat Model & Scope

**Important:** This tool is designed to execute PowerShell commands generated by an LLM. By definition, it enables Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE).

When reporting vulnerabilities, please distinguish between **intended functionality** and **actual security flaws**:

### Intended Functionality (Not a Vulnerability)
* The ability to execute system commands (e.g., `Get-Process`, `Remove-Item`) is a feature, not a bug.
* The LLM generating incorrect or destructive commands is a limitation of the model, not a vulnerability in this server.
* Executing commands with the privileges of the user running the server process.

### In Scope (Vulnerabilities)
* **Sandbox Escapes:** If you configure the server to run in a restricted mode (if applicable) and a command manages to bypass those restrictions.
* **Command Injection (Internal):** If the server fails to properly sanitize internal arguments before passing them to the PowerShell subprocess, resulting in execution different from what the LLM requested.
* **Unauthorized Access:** If the server is exposed via HTTP/SSE and allows connections without configured authentication.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability that falls within the scope above, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

1.  **Email:** Send a detailed report to [INSERT YOUR EMAIL HERE].
2.  **Encryption:** If possible, encrypt your message using our PGP key: [LINK TO KEY OR FINGERPRINT] (Optional).
3.  **Timeline:** We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.

## Best Practices for Users

To use this server safely, we recommend the following:

1.  **Human-in-the-Loop:** Always use an MCP client that requires user confirmation before executing tools (e.g., Claude Desktop in "Ask before running" mode).
2.  **Least Privilege:** Do not run this server as Administrator/Root unless absolutely necessary.
3.  **Sandboxing:** Where possible, run this server inside a container (Docker) or a virtual machine to limit the impact of destructive commands.
4.  **Network Isolation:** Ensure the server is not exposed to the public internet.
