    in the config dict.

    The attributes defined in this class override keys of the same name placed in the config dict.
    Attributes set to None will let the duckdb default value take effect.

    Changing settings not declared as attributes of this class can make agentune code not work correctly.
    In particular, these settings are controlled directly and cannot be changed via the config dict:
    - storage_compatibility_version
    - python_enable_replacements

    Params:
        max_memory: The maximum amount of memory to use for both in-memory databases and temporary storage during
                    queries on all databases. When this limit is exceeded, duckdb starts writing to the temp directory.
                    Can be specified in units of bytes with various suffixes, eg '1GB'.

                    The default is 80% of available system RAM. (You cannot currently specify a different percentage.)
        temp_dir:   The directory to write to when duckdb runs out of memory. This applies to in-memory databases
                    that don't fit in memory and also to temporary storage during queries.
                    The directory will only be created when duckdb runs out of in-process memory, and it will be deleted
                    on exit.
                    The default if this field is set to None is '.tmp' in the current working dir in in-memory mode,
                    or <database_name>.tmp otherwise.
        max_temp_directory_size: The maximum size of the temp directory. When this limit is exceeded, queries fail.
                                 Can be specified in units of bytes with various suffixes, eg '1GB'.

                                 The default is 90% of the current free disk space. (You cannot currently specify a
                                 different percentage.)
                                 Note that the free disk space is checked only once, on startup. If the space is later
                                 consumed by some other data (including the non-temporary data in the same database!)
                                 the filesystem can still run out of free space. Thus, setting this to a percentage
                                 is mostly useful when you place the temp directory on a different filesystem from the
                                 main database.
        threads:    number of (native) threads used by duckdb. The default if this field is set to None
                    is the number of CPU cores available.
        config:     additional parameters that will be passed to duckdb as-is (see the `config` parameter to `duckdb.connect`).
                    Fields explicitly declared in this class override values in the config dict.

class DuckdbManager:
    """Manages duckdb databases and connections, and relatedly, the size and creation of the duckbd threadpool(s).

    This class is NOT thread-safe while you're attaching or detaching databases.
    Afterwards, connection instances you acquire from the cursor() method are also not thread-safe,
    and every thread needs to acquire its own connection. You may also wish to create cursors
    to separate connection-level effects like transactions and USE statements.

    Each instance of this class starts out by connecting to one database and can attach more databases later.
    A single threadpool is used, no matter how many databases are attached.
    Attaching and detaching databases affects all connection instances previously returned by cursor().
        
    The default database (out of those attached) is always the first one; you can execute USE on a connection
    to change it locally, but this doesn't affect other connections.

    The class instance always keeps an open connection instance, so closing all connections outside of this class
    will not free any resources until this class's own .close() is called.
    Code SHOULD scope the use of connection instances obtained from this class, so that resources are freed
    when this class is eventually closed.
    
    There is currently no way to forcibly close a database instance (discard an in-memory database, release files, close threads)
    while live (python) connections remain. We can implement this in the future by using lower-level duckdb APIs.

    The main database (passed to the constructor) is always attached under the default name given to it by duckdb.
    This is the file basename for on-disk databases, and 'memory' for in-memory databases.
    This is a duckdb limitation. Databases attached later can use arbitrary names.

    The following database names are reserved and may NOT be used for either the primary database or later attached ones:

    - 'system', 'temp': reserved by duckdb
    - 'memory': this is the (unchangeable) name used by the primary database, if it's in-memory. To avoid confusion,
                it cannot be used for on-disk databases, or for secondary databases attached later (even if they're in-memory).

    The following schema names are reserved:

    - 'main': the default schema created with every database; code should not try to delete it or (re)create it
    - 'information_schema', 'pg_catalog': reserved by duckdb
    - 'agentune_temp': used by this library for temporary tables and views. This schema is created (empty) when this class
                       connects to a primary database (unless in read-only mode). It is dropped on exit. It is also dropped
                       with all its contents if we discover it exists on start-up (left over from a previous run).
                       This schema is not created in databases attached later.

                       Code should use `DuckdbManager.temp_schema_name`, not the literal name.
