"""Raw extraction plan creation orchestrator.

This module provides the main orchestrator for creating raw extraction plans
from Claude Code session logs.

Two-stage preprocessing architecture:
1. Stage 1: Deterministic mechanical reduction (session_preprocessing)
2. Stage 2: Haiku distillation (llm_distillation) - semantic judgment calls

Stage 2 is controlled by USE_LLM_DISTILLATION constant.

## Objective

Analyze session context to identify documentation gaps and create documentation improvements.

## Source

- **Branch:** {branch_name}
- **Session IDs:** See plan-header metadata
- **Session Data:** See comments below

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Read Session Data

Read and parse the session XML from the issue comments below. The XML contains:
- `<session>` blocks: Individual conversation sessions
- `<user>` and `<assistant>` elements: Conversation turns
- `<tool_use>` and `<tool_result>`: Tool invocations and results

### Step 2: Verify Existing Documentation

Before analyzing gaps, scan the project:
- `docs/learned/` - Existing agent docs
- `.claude/skills/` - Existing skills
- `docs/learned/glossary.md` - Terms and definitions

### Step 3: Identify Category A - Learning Gaps

Documentation that would have made the session MORE EFFICIENT. Signals:
- Repeated explanations of the same concept
- Trial-and-error before finding the right approach
- Extensive codebase exploration for core patterns
- User redirecting the agent's approach
- WebSearch/WebFetch for locally-documentable info

### Step 4: Identify Category B - Teaching Gaps

Documentation needed for what was BUILT. Signals:
- New CLI commands (need glossary + routing entries)
- New constants/labels (need glossary entries)
- New patterns established (need agent doc)
- New configuration options
- New ABC/interfaces

### Step 5: Categorize Each Finding

For each finding, determine:
- **Type:** Agent Doc (`docs/learned/`) or Skill (`.claude/skills/`)
- **Action:** New doc | Update existing | Merge into
- **Priority:** High (significant friction) | Medium | Low

### Step 6: Generate Documentation

For each suggestion:
1. Create the documentation file with draft content
2. Add routing entry to AGENTS.md if applicable
3. Update glossary.md for new terms/commands

### Step 7: Verify Changes

Run `make fast-ci` to validate all changes pass CI.

---

## Output Format

For each documentation item created, report:
- File path created/updated
- Type (Agent Doc, Skill, Glossary, Routing)
- Brief description of what was documented
