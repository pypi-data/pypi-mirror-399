# About
This repository contains the source code for apmodel.

apmodel provides model implementations for Activity Streams 2.0, CryptographicKey (Security Vocabulary v1), Multikey and DataIntegrityProof (Controlled Identifiers v1.0), and PropertyValue (schema.org).

## Features
- A `load` function that automatically reads the `type` key from JSON and converts it to the correct model. It returns the original JSON if no matching model is found.
- If a key from the JSON does not correspond to a field in the model, it is added to the model's `model_extra` dictionary.
