# tmux-fork
Fork you current tmux pane into a new pane named after the directory that you are in.

Useful when you are multitasking

Vibe coded but will become less so often time.

Liable to change, part of what I do. Will give you more useful features.

I like small tools for productivity. This stuff is becoming even more useful in the time of AI (though much of it might be coded by you). 

If you are interested in this sort of thing you can follow me on X at @readwithai. Or look at the tools page on my blog.
