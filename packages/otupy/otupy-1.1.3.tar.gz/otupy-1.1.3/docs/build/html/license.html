<h3>2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence<a class="headerlink" href="#scope-of-the-rights-granted-by-the-licence" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright
vested in the Original Work:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,</p></li>

<li><p>distribute the Work or copies thereof,</p></li>
<li><p>lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,</p></li>
<li><p>sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats,
whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable law
permits so.</p>
<p>In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right
to exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to
make effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.</p>
<p>The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage
rights to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to
make use of the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.</p>
</section>
<section id="communication-of-the-source-code">
<h3>3. Communication of the Source Code<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-of-the-source-code" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the
Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code
of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor
distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice
attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and
freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute or
communicate the Work.</p>
</section>
<section id="limitations-on-copyright">
<h3>4. Limitations on copyright<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations-on-copyright" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the
benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the
rights owners in the Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other
applicable limitations thereto.</p>
</section>
<section id="obligations-of-the-licensee">
<h3>5. Obligations of the Licensee<a class="headerlink" href="#obligations-of-the-licensee" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions
and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the
following:</p>
<p>Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent
or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to
the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such
notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she
distributes or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work
to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and
the date of modification.</p>
<p>Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of
the Original Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or
Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later
version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly
distributed only under this version of the Licence — for example by
communicating ‘EUPL v. 1.2 only’. The Licensee (becoming Licensor)
cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or
Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.</p>
<p>Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates
Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another
work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or
Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence.
For the sake of this clause, ‘Compatible Licence’ refers to the licences
listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee’s
obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her
obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible
Licence shall prevail.</p>
<p>Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of
the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the
Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily
and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute
or communicate the Work.</p>
<p>Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the
trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except
as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of
the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.</p>
</section>
<section id="chain-of-authorship">
<h3>6. Chain of Authorship<a class="headerlink" href="#chain-of-authorship" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work
granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that
he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.</p>
<p>Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she
brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that
he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.</p>
<p>Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work,
under the terms of this Licence.</p>
</section>
<section id="disclaimer-of-warranty">
<h3>7. Disclaimer of Warranty<a class="headerlink" href="#disclaimer-of-warranty" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by
numerous Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore
contain defects or ‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development.</p>
<p>For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an ‘as
is’ basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work,
including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of
intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6
of this Licence.</p>
<p>This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a
condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.</p>
</section>
<section id="disclaimer-of-liability">
<h3>8. Disclaimer of Liability<a class="headerlink" href="#disclaimer-of-liability" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to
natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct
or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the
Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages
for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been
advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be
liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to
the Work.</p>
</section>
<section id="additional-agreements">
<h3>9. Additional agreements<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-agreements" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional
agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this
Licence. However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own
behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original
Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred
by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have
accepted any warranty or additional liability.</p>
</section>
<section id="acceptance-of-the-licence">

requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and
the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the
Licensee.</p>
</section>
<section id="termination-of-the-licence">
<h3>12. Termination of the Licence<a class="headerlink" href="#termination-of-the-licence" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the
Licence.</p>
<p>Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has
received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such
persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.</p>

<p>Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the
complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work.</p>
