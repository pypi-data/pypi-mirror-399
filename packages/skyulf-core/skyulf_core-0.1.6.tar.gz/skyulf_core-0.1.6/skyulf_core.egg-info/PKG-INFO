# Skyulf Core

**Skyulf Core** (`skyulf-core`) is the standalone machine learning library that powers the Skyulf MLOps platform. It provides a robust, type-safe, and modular set of tools for:

- **Data Preprocessing**: A comprehensive suite of transformers for cleaning, scaling, encoding, and feature engineering.
- **Modeling**: Unified interfaces for classification and regression models, wrapping Scikit-Learn and other libraries.
- **Pipeline Management**: Tools to build, serialize, and execute complex ML pipelines.
- **Tuning**: Advanced hyperparameter tuning capabilities with support for Grid Search, Random Search, and Optuna.
- **Evaluation**: Standardized metrics and evaluation schemas for model performance tracking.
