### FAQ
How does Python handle locale?  
The [locale](https://docs.python.org/3/library/locale.html#module-locale) module is implemented on top of the _locale module, which in turn uses an ANSI [C locale](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/817-2521/overview-1002/index.html) (also called the "POSIX locale") implementation if available. The C locale is often described as "culture-neutral" because it doesn't apply any regional or language-specific rules for formatting data. It is a basic, system-independent locale that follows standardized rules for formatting data such as numbers, dates, and currency. The C locale uses U.S.-style conventions by default, such as:
- Period (.) as the decimal point for numbers
- Simple ASCII character classification and sorting
- English-style date and time formats
