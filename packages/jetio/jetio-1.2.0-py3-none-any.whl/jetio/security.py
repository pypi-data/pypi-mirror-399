"""
Security utilities for the Jetio framework.

This module centralizes ownership/audit-field discovery logic so that:
- CrudRouter can auto-populate ownership fields consistently on CREATE.
- Authorization dependencies (e.g. owner_or_admin) can identify the same
  ownership fields consistently on UPDATE/DELETE.

The intent is to keep ownership behavior predictable and to prevent
security regressions when models use different conventional field names.
