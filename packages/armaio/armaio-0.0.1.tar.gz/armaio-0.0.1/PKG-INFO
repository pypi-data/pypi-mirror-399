# ArmaIO

**ArmaIO** is a Python package providing utilities to read and write file formats specific to the Arma 3 game, and its Real Virtuality 4 engine.

The modules coming with this package were originally developed as part of the [Arma 3 Object Builder plugin](https://github.com/MrClock8163/Arma3ObjectBuilder) for Blender. They are released in this standalone package to facilitate independent use, and easier maintenance.
