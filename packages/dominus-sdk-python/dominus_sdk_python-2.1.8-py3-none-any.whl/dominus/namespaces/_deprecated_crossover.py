"""Crossover (admin) operations namespace - DEPRECATED

Note: This namespace has been removed from the SDK.
Provisioning and admin operations should be done via Architect's
/api/crossover endpoint directly, not through the SDK.

This file is kept as a placeholder to prevent import errors in
any code that may still reference it.

# Empty file - all crossover functionality removed
