Rivista Voyager
===============

Rivista Journal is a syndicated publishing system for XMPP.

It is an open-source, minimalist journaling platform which is designed for
writers who want a simple and distraction-free writing experience.

It is built to support the XMPP protocol, allowing people to publish content
which can be shared and discovered across different platforms, such as Blasta,
Libervia, and Movim, over the decentralized network.

In addition to being cost-effective and having low maintenance overhead, Rivista
Journal focuses on providing a clean interface that emphasizes writing and
reading without the clutter often associated with more complex content
management systems.

About
-----

Rivista Voyager is a syndication platform which hosts journals and publications
over multiple networks, such as Gemini, HTTP, and XMPP, and it is usable with
any RSS Reader and Browser; it also showcases the innecessity of HTML templates,
as XSLT stylesheets can automatically generate valid XHTML documents by HTML
browsers (client-side), from XML documents that Rivista Voyager generates.

With special attention to XMPP, one of the advantages of XMPP PubSub, is that it
is possible to view a complete set of node items, and even a single node item,
which means, that Rivista Voyager significantly reduces bandwidth costs and
system overhead, which includes CPU, I/O and RAM usage.

It can act as both dynamic and static publishing platform.

Technology
----------

Rivista Voyager is based upon The Atom Syndication Format, and XMPP PubSub.

Rivista includes XSLT stylesheets that transform Atom documents into XHTML
documents, which simultaneously makes it compatible with both RSS Readers and
Browsers.

Rivista was inspired from project Sure.IM of Tigase, and was further motivated
by project Movim.

Importance
----------

The technologies that are utilized by Rivista Voyager were predicted over a
couple of decades ago by Mr. Robin Cover, Mr. Hank Simon, and Mr. Todd Boyle
have predicted an internet which is accessible to everyone; however, the so
called “Browser War”, which was actually a PsyOp (psychological operation)
campaign, has distracted the attention of people from the actual potential of
the internet as it was really meant to be.

Principles
----------

The policies of so called "community" and "inclusion" "guidelines" are
deceiving, phony, and are meant to delude us to exclude people of certain
opinions, and thereby to neglect actual positive causes.

We deem that **everyone** has to have an equal access to the internet;

.. epigraph:: Everyone (pronoun) /ˈev.ri.wʌn/

   Everyone, every one, every body, every man, every woman.

Everyone, from everywhere, and by every mean;

From people who use a Pager, PDA, or Music Player; from richer to poorer people;
from younger to older people; and everyone else, without an exception;

Free speech is by and for everyone and may not be selective, because if we
accept to silence one, who is not fond of us, or who we do not fond of, we will
eventually silence ourselves.

* Accessibility;
* Freedom;
* Independency;
* Portability;
* Privacy;
* Mobility; and
* Speech.

Technicalities
--------------

Atom Syndication Format as API for content delivery.

All documents are structured in standard XML files, such as Atom Syndication
Format, OPML, and Sitemap.

* All content is accessible via any mean.

* Every content is sourced from Atom Syndication Format.

* Navigation is managed by directives in each content document, and it may
  managed by XML Sitemap files.

* All generated data is portable and standard; documents are made of Atom
  Syndication Format and XHTML documents are generated by XSLT (XSL
  Transformations) stylesheets that can shape XML data as required.

* Plugins may be provided in the form of client-side ECMAScript (JavaScript).

Motivation
----------

Standards driven.

Rivista Voyager produces XML files, and XSLT stylesheets are functioning as a so
called "templating engine" of it.

There are over three hundred of free and open source content management systems,
yet there are fundamental and common problems.

* None is yet to provide a comprehensive, standard, and customizable platform;

* Not all provide built-in syndications;

* Most of the platforms that do provide syndications offer the non-standard RSS
  2.0 instead of standard Atom Syndication Format 1.0; and

* Most platforms either provide a fixed form of design, or a need of a so called
  "templating engine", which means that software-specific modifications have to
  be made in order to customize a site (e.g. studying Python in order to create
  a theme), while also being relied on a singular or several third-party
  software.

* As centralized publishing platforms such, as HTTP, are being lesser and lesser
  popular, platforms should treat to decentralized publishing platforms in an
  equal manner to centralized platforms, similarly to Blogo which publishes to
  Nostr.

https://jamstack.org/generators/

Rivista Voyager is both a publishing and syndication platform which is entirely
made of the standard Extensible Markup Language (XML), mainly Atom Syndication
Format (Atom), and XSL Transformations (XSLT); it generates XML documents from
reStructuredText files and, with XSLT stylesheets, those XML documents are
transformed into XHTML; this means, that the customization is done by editing
XSLT and CSS stylesheets, and without any need of studying computer languages
such as Perl, Python, or Ruby.

**Stages:** reStructuredText > (converted) > XML > (processed by XSLT) > XHTML.

So, publishing systems which also produce Atom Syndication Format documents
would have themes that be compatible with the themes of Rivista Voyager.

Installing
----------

It is possible to install Rivista Voyager using pip or pipx.

pip
```

Create a "venv" directory.

.. code:: sh

   $ python3 -m venv .venv
   $ source .venv/bin/activate

Install.

.. code:: sh

   $ pip install git+https://git.xmpp-it.net/sch/Rivista

pipx
````

Install.

.. code:: sh

   $ pipx install git+https://git.xmpp-it.net/sch/Rivista

Update.

.. code:: sh

   $ pipx uninstall rivista
   $ pipx install git+https://git.xmpp-it.net/sch/Rivista

Processing
----------

Install theme.

.. code:: sh

   $ rivista-adjust

Process content.

.. code:: sh

   $ rivista-build

Utilize keyword arguments `gemini`, `http`, or `xmpp` to selectively create data
to one or several of these platforms. When no argument is selected, Rivista
Voyager will create all possible data.

Operating
---------

.. code:: sh

   $ rivista-server

Utilize keyword arguments `gemini` or `http` selectively operate either server.
When no argument is selected, Rivista Voyager will operate both servers.
