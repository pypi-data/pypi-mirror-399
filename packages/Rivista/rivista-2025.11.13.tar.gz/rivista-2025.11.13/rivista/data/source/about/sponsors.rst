The next generation internet initiative envisions the information age will be an
era that brings out the best in all of us.

We want to enable human potential, mobility and creativity at the largest
possible scale – while dealing responsibly with our natural resources.

In order to preserve and expand the European way of life, the programme helps
shape a value-centric, human and inclusive Internet for all.

The non-profit NLnet Foundation was formally started in 1989 as an independent
legal entity, but incorporates networking activities since 1982.

The foundation (in Dutch called “Stichting NLnet” or shortly “NLnet”) had a
major role in raising the so-called pan-European “UNIX” Network and the
commercial and public internet network provision in the Netherlands.
