.. summary: A markup syntax.
.. title: reStructuredText
.. type: text

reStructuredText is an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext
markup syntax and parser system. It is useful for in-line program documentation
(such as Python docstrings), for quickly creating simple internet pages, and for
standalone documents.

reStructuredText is designed for extensibility for specific application domains.
The reStructuredText parser is a component of Docutils. reStructuredText is a
revision and reinterpretation of the StructuredText and Setext lightweight
markup systems.

The primary purpose of reStructuredText is to define and implement a markup
syntax for use in Python docstrings and other documentation domains, that is
readable and simple, yet powerful enough for non-trivial use.

The intended purpose of the markup is the conversion of reStructuredText
documents into useful structured data formats.
