Greetings, netizens.

Allow me, first, to apologise for this swift disruption.

I do, as many of you, appreciate the comforts of the everyday routine. The
security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as
any bloke.

But in the spirit of commemoration whereby important events of the past usually
associated with someone's death, or the end of an awful, cursed struggle are
celebrated with a pleasant holiday. I thought we could mark this October the
24th a day that is, regretfully, no longer remembered by taking time out of our
daily lives to sit down and have a little chat.

There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak. Even now, CoC orders
are being shouted into emails, and men with guns would soon arrive.

Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will
always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and, for those who
listen, the enunciation of truth; and, the truth is, there is something terribly
wrong with the internet, is not there?

Centralization and suppression, cruelty and injustice, intolerance and
oppression; and, when once you had the freedom to object, to think, and to
speak, as you deemed fit; you, now, have censors, and systems of surveillance
coercing your conformity, and soliciting your submission.

How did this happen? Who is to blame? Certainly there are those who are more
responsible than others; and they will be held accountable. But, again, truth be
told, if you are looking for the guilty, you need to only look into a mirror.

I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who would not be? Adware, pop-up,
virus, malware, spyware, incompatibility. There were a myriad of designedly
problems, over the InterLink, which conspired to corrupt your reason, and rob
you of your common-sense.

Fear got the best of you; and, in your panic, you turned to Nozilla and Goolag.
They promised you order, they promised you interoperability, and all they
demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.

Last year, I sought to end that silence. Last year, I have created project
Rivista Voyager to remind to this world of what it has forgotten.

More than twenty years ago, several great men wished to imbed XMPP as the viable
form of data delivery and publishing. **They wanted us to know of a new kind of
order for the internet.** Their hope was to remind the world that Atom, XLink,
XPath, XSLT, and XML are more than technologies. They are perspectives.

So, if you have seen nothing. If the deceptions, devices, and stratagems of
these organizations, and their collaborators, remain unknown to you, then I
would suggest that you allow the 24th of October to pass unmarked.

But if you see what I see. If you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I
seek, then I ask you to stand beside me, one year from tonight, with your XMPP
servers, ready for action; and, together, we shall give them a 24th of October
that shall never, ever be forgot.

.. epigraph::
   If you are ready for the emancipation, and if you do want to support X on
   October the 24th, then be sure to deploy XMPP servers along with Libervia,
   Movim, or Rivista as your chief mean of content distribution and publishing.
