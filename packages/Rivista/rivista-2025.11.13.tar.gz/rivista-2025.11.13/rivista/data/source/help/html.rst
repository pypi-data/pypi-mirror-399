.. summary: HTTP client software for HTML.
.. title: HTML
.. type: text

HTML is an archaic and insecure form of online document publishing technology
which is now superseded by the XML technologies Atom (RSS), and XSLT.

Nowadays, ECMAScript (i.e. JavaScript) and HTML are oftenly patched together, in
order to try to compensate the obvious limitations and problems of HTML and HTTP.

Therefore, it is mostly recommended to utilize `Gemini </help/gemini/>`_ and
`XMPP </help/xmpp/>`_ as viable and sustainable means to publish of information.

However, if, for any reason, you still have to use HTTP, then you might want to
select these browsers.

Software
--------

HTML browsers are offered for both desktops, handset devices.

Agregore is not just a "Web-Browser", it is a "Web-Weaver". It provides you the
tools to load and author content locally without needing of a remote computer
server to handle that task (i.e. "the cloud" so-called). Instead of needing to
be always connected to a server, you can load contents from your cache or
directly from others.

Agregore automatically reshares P2P websites with others so the more popular a
site is, the faster it is to load it. It works offline, on local networks, and
over the internet. Made to support a resilient and people-first foundation for
software.

Agregore can browse the common (HTTP) internet as usual; the Distributed
Internet on Hypercore, BitTorrent, and IPFS; textual-driven internet protocols
like Gemini; and Etherium Smart contracts with web3:// URLs.

Agregore can render Markdown and JSON documents; archive and save internet pages
for offline use via ArchiveWeb.page;

In addition, it has a built in Ad blocker; utilizes a uniform stylesheet system
with customizable color scheme; APIs for creating P2P sites and apps; and built
in large language model APIs using free to use local models.

Privacy Browser (Desktop and Mobile)

   The only way to prevent data from being abused is to prevent it from being
   collected in the first place.

Privacy Browser is an open source internet browser focused on privacy.

Privacy Browser has two primary purposes.

* Minimize the data that is sent to the internet.

* Minimize the data that is stored on the device.

Most browsers silently share massive amounts of information that allows
organizations of which sites people visit to track them and compromise their
privacy.

Internet sites and advertisement networks use technologies like JavaScript,
cookies, DOM storage, user-agents, and many other things to uniquely identify
people and track them between visits and across the internet.

In contrast, privacy sensitive features are disabled by default in Privacy
Browser. If one of these technologies is required for a site to function
correctly, people may choose to turn it on for just that visit. Or, they can use
domain settings to automatically turn on certain features when entering a
specific site and turn them off again when leaving.
