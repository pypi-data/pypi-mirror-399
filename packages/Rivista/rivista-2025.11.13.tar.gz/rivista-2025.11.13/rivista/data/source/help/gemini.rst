.. summary: Gemini client software.
.. title: Gemini
.. type: text

Gemini is a new internet technology supporting an electronic library of
interconnected text documents.

That is not a new idea, but it is not old fashioned either. It is timeless, and
deserves tools which treat it as a first-class concept, not a vestigial issue.

Gemini is meant for building a lightweight online realm where documents are just
documents, in the interests of every reader's privacy, attention and bandwidth.

Gemini is a deliberately restrictive protocol which concerns privacy and people
first. Gemini pages are loaded with a single socket request; this means, no
tracking cookies, no tracking pixels, and no tracking while browsing across
different pages or sites

Software
--------

Gemini browsers are offered for both desktops, handset devices.

Agregore (Desktop and Mobile)

Agregore is made to support a resilient and people-first foundation for
software, and it has an extensive support for PPNs (peer-to-peer networks).
It works offline, on local networks, and over the internet.

Agregore can browse the common (HTTP) internet as usual; the Distributed Web on
Hypercore, BitTorrent, and IPFS; textual-driven internet protocols like Gemini;
and Etherium Smart contracts with web3:// URLs.

apps, will be added, further expanding its capabilities and appeal.

Peersky is designed for everyone, making it easy for people to own and explore
the internet while enhancing privacy and digital autonomy—without relying on
archaic internet infrastructure.
