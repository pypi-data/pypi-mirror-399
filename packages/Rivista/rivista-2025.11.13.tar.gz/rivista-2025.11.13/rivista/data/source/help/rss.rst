.. summary: News client software for RSS.
.. title: RSS
.. type: text

RSS (Rich Site Summary) is a mean for *real-time* information.

RSS is a structural file format which is specifically meant to "syndicate"
contents, similar to how comic strips and popular columns are syndicated by
their owners to hundreds of newspapers. Except that is done by computers over
the internet. The content that is syndicated in RSS is often not the full
entry, but excerpts and links back to the originating article, so it is
recommended to use Atom Syndication Format which is the current standard of RSS.

Software

Feed Readers are offered for desktops, handset devices, and HTML browsers.
