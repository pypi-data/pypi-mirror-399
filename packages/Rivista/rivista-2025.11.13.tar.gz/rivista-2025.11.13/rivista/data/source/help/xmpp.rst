LeechCraft is a free open source modular system which offers anything that you
would possibly want from an internet client software, and by installing
different modules you can customize the feature set, keeping off the things you
do not need and getting a decent IM client, media player, BitTorrent client, or
a feed reader.

Blasta is a collaborative bookmarks manager for organizing online content.

It allows you to add links to your personal collection of links, to categorize
them with keywords, and to share and synchronize your collection among your own
software, devices, machines, and also with others.

The ability of Blasta to display to you the links that other people have
collected and shared, as well as showing you who else has bookmarked a specific
link is what makes Blasta a collaborative system.

You can also view the links collected by others, and subscribe to the links of
people whose lists you deem to be interesting.

Libervia (formerly, Salut à Toi) is a multi-purpose platform to manage all your
communications needs: events, file sharing, forums, instant messaging,
journaling (blogging), photo albums, podcasts, tasks, et cetera.

Libervia is a Libre software, based on well established standards (XMPP),
decentralised and federating. It is developed around strong ethical values.

The project "Libervia" was emerged from a need to protect our liberties, our
privacy and our independence. It is intended to protect the rights and liberties
that people have regarding own private and numeric data, acquaintance's, and the
handled data; it is also intended to be a human contact point, not substituting
itself to physical encounters, but rather facilitating them. Libervia will
always fight against all forms of technology control by private interests. The
global network must belong to everybody, and be a force of expression and
freedom for all Humanity.

.. epigraph::

   Microblogging is not only logging thoughts to a database.

   It is about communication. And it is about communication with focus on NOW.

   So we need real time capabilities back.

   Polling is expensive and limited. Microblogging should be more of chatting.

   Maybe an initial post is often a start for various conversations.

   Microblogging is a service for the real masses - they just do not know yet.

   And if it is for the masses we need decentralization.
