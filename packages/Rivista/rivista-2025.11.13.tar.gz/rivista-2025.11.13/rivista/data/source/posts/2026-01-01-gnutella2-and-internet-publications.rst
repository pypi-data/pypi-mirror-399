.. title: Gnutella2 and internet publications

G2
--

Gnutella2 (G2) is an efficient Peer-to-Peer network standard and architecture
which is designed to provide a solid foundation for distributed world services
such as person to person communication, data location and transfer, and other
future services, such as journal publication.

Ace
---

Atom Centric Elevation (Ace) is a hyper-protocol and versatile document standard
which is designed to provide a document format which is fast, portable, and
usable over any network. It is an XML file of type `application/atom+xml` which
is based upon Atom Syndication Format and XML Linking Language (XLink).

Potential
---------

The incorporation of Ace with G2 software would allow to anyone to publish
articles to everyone and possibly (optionally) with additional insignificant
costs for a centralized internet site with a single or few referential pages, to
G2 documents, that may be hosted on a PC computer or even on an OpenWrt router.

Conclusion
----------

Adding basic HTML and XML interpreters to G2 software would allow to utilize G2
sotfware as fast and lightweight publication browsers (i.e. internet browsers).
