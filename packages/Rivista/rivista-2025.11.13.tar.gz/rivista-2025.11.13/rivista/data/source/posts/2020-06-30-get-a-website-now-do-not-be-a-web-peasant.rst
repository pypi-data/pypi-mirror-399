.. summary:
   You need to establish a website. Now.
   If you do not have your own website, you are just living as a peasant on
   BitChute, Rumble, or GAB virtual apartments. Get your own domain name and a
   VPS to host everything you need. The startup and maintenance costs are pocket
   change and you get a degree of independence unseen in the modern controlled
   internet.
