.. summary:
   P2P (Peer-to-peer) is a technology for the distribution of information.
   Unlike centralized source, P2P relys on the identity of files that are being
   published and distributed. Data which is accessible over centralized
   portocols such as FTP, Gemini, Gopher, HTTP, MQTT, RSYNC, WebDAV, and XMPP
   are subjected to change; and yet P2P links (URIs) never change. P2P helps
   courts, journals, legislatures, ministries scholars, and others to create
   permanent records of sources that they cite. P2P is simple, easy to use, and
   is built and supported by everyone.

P2P
```

P2P (Peer-to-peer) is a technology for the distribution of permanent information
utilizing immutable checksums.

Unlike centralized source, P2P relys on the identity of files that are being
published and distributed.

FTP, Gemini, Gopher, HTTP, MQTT, RSYNC, WebDAV, and XMPP sites are subjected to
change; and yet P2P links (URIs) never change.

P2P helps courts, journals, legislatures, ministries scholars, and others to
create permanent records of sources that they cite.

P2P is simple, easy to use, and is built and supported by everyone.
