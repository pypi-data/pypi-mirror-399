.. title: Welcome to Rivista Voyager
.. type: text

Publish and consume news feeds via XMPP.

Rivista Voyager is a syndicated publication system for XMPP.

It is an open-source, minimalist journaling platform which is designed for
writers who want a simple and distraction-free writing experience.

It is built to support the XMPP protocol, allowing people to publish content
which can be shared and discovered across different platforms, such as
Blasta, Libervia, and Movim, over the decentralized network.

In addition to being cost-effective and having low maintenance overhead,
Rivista focuses on providing a clean interface that emphasizes writing and
reading without the clutter often associated with more complex content
management systems.
