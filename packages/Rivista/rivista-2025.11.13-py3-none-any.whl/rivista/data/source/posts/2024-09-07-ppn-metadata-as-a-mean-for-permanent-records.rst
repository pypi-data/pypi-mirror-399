.. summary: Magnet Links as a sustainable mean of reference.
   Utilize PPN (peer-to-peer networking) technology as a mean for authors and
   journalists to create permanent links for citations in their published work.
   Because centralized protocols are not designed to last forever, invalid links
   to FTP, Gemini, Gopher, HTTP, and even XMPP are too prevalent, and unless
   they are sourced from I2P, invalid links tend to compound over time.
   Utilize P2P technology to to sustain your content to an unlimited period of
   time.

In order for courts, journals, scholars, and others to have permanent records of
sources that they cite, PPN is the only viable option to consider.

Problem
```````

Unless I2P is utilized, publications that are hosted over FTP, Gemini, Gopher,
HTTP, and XMPP could be blocked, censored, change, and defunct.

Yet, even when decentrlized systems, such as I2P, are utilized, the pathnames of
sites could still change, whether intentionally or otherwise.

P2P
```

P2P (Peer-to-peer) is a technology for the distribution of permanent information
utilizing immutable checksums.

Unlike centralized source, P2P relys on the identity of files that are being
published and distributed.

FTP, Gemini, Gopher, HTTP, and XMPP sites are subjected to change; and yet P2P
links (URIs) never change.

P2P helps courts, journals, legislatures, ministries scholars, and others to
create permanent records of sources that they cite.

P2P is simple, easy to use, and is built and supported by libraries.

Missing links
`````````````

Missing links (colloquially and informally referred to as “broken links”) is a
reference to URI/URL resources that are not valid as the original poster has
initially intended.

It is a state of affairs when a link to an online document is altreed, blank
(empty), deleted, moved, reorganized, or hijacked.

Navigating to a missing link usually results in an error "not found", which is
one of the main reasons to utilize PPN metadata.

So it is, when linked citations refer to online pages that are not as they were
when initially linked and referred to, then this type of situation is referred
to as “broken link”.

Those who cites links of centralized resources are affected
-----------------------------------------------------------

Over 70% of cited links in court opinions, legislation houses, and ministries
are not directing to their intended documents.

Roughly 90% of cited links in academic journals and 20% of all science,
technology, and medicine articles are subjected to broken links.

Missing links are not helpful to the erectness of your citations
----------------------------------------------------------------

At the first couple of years, this might not appear to be of an issue; yet

At the third or fifth year, or even after months, the amount of invalid or
inaccessible links is expected to reach to 30% in average; and

At the sixth or ninth year, the amount of links is expected to be 60% in
average; and

As time furthers, the amount is expected to reach to 90% and then it is expected
to conclude at an utter failure of 100% invalidity.

Missing links are inevitable and oftenly irreversible.

Introducing Magnet Link
```````````````````````

A Magnet Link is a reliable and unbreakable link to an unalterable record of any
content that you cite.

It can be considered as a “time capsule” for any type of content, such as
articles, music, photos, videos, and other sorts of multimedia, which anyone can
obtain.

Preservation by design
----------------------

PPN was made for content to be preserved and for people to be mutually committed
to the preservation of contents.

P2P helps courts, journals, and scholars to prevent missing links by creating
permanent, reliable, unalterable Magnet Links to the sources cited in researches
and works.

Once a Magnet Link is created and its content is distributed for a few days,
neither its content nor its address will change, not even during war time or
internet collapse.

Q: Who operates and owns P2P?

A: Everyone, from individuals to organizations.

Q: How long do Magnet Links last?

A: For as long as at least some **one** has the actual content and distributes it.

Q: Can I delete a Magnet Link?

A: No.

Q: Can I stop sharing my contents, after they were once distributed?

A: No. Once distributed, it is impossible to stop the further distribution of already shared contents.

Q: Is P2P open source?

A: Yes. It is an open and free specification to everyone.

It is easy to create and utilize Magnet Links.

.. epigraph::

   Arrange. Select. Magnet.

Phase 1
'''''''

Save an internet page which you want to preserve, and save it as Atom
Syndication Format, EPUB, HTMLZ, MHTML, or XHTML.

Phase 2
'''''''

Create a Metalink or Torrent file from the desired files, or copy the Magnet
Link from the list of shared files in eMule or Shareaza, and PPN metadata would
do the rest.

Phase 3
'''''''

Share and distribute the content of your Magnet Link.

Phase 4
'''''''

Use the Magnet Link in your citations.

Finally
'''''''

Use your Magnet Link as you would cite URL addresses.

Your Magnet Link citation is safe from failures, and it will never change, and
it will be valid as long as there is at least someone to share this content.

Designed to sustain
-------------------

Libraries are strongly in the lasting business.

PPN is a guaranty to preserving digital records to the same standards that
people preserve physical records.

That is why tens of millions of people a day trust P2P with their contents and
citations.

Libraries
'''''''''

Libraries comprise a critical role in powering and supporting P2P.

Courts
''''''

Courts demand long-term reliability from the links in their decisions.

Other organizations
'''''''''''''''''''

There are wide-ranging applications for P2P tools.

Individuals
'''''''''''

Anyone can download a free P2P software and start creating Magnet Links.

Caveat emptor
`````````````

Please beware of imposters.

It is important to realize, that anyone who offers a permanent record service
which is exclusively structured and relied on centralized means (e.g. FTP, HTTP,
RSYNC et cetera), and without providing eD2k, IPFS, Magnet Link, Metalink, or
Torrent references, is a cheat and a fraud.

It is impossible to offer a reliable and permanent record, unless it is based on
P2P technology, as of BitTorrent, eDonkey2000, Gnutella, IPFS, MUTE, et cetera.
