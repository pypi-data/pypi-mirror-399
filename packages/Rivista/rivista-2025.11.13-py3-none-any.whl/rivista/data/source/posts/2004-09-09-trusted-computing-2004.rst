Trust.

Trust is the personal belief in correctness of something;

It is the deep conviction of truth and rightness, and cannot be enforced;

If you gain someone's trust, you have established an interpersonal relationship,
based on communication, shared values and experiences;

Trust always depends on mutuality.

This process has been reshaped by the computer industry;

Now, a microchip does that task for you;

The industry calls it: “Trusted Computing”;

This chip will be in computers, notebooks, servers, PDAs, cell phones, game
units, DVD players, set-top boxes, watches, mixers, steam irons, fridges, fire
extinguishers, earplugs, toilets, dogs [...] game-units, and it will be in your
devices too.

What has Trusted Computing to do with trust?

Let us show you.

In a Trusted Computing environment, the major goal is to protect us from
potential threats;

The original Trusted Computing idea is designed to let you decide what to
consider as threat, and what to consider trustworthy;

You can control by your own personal conviction.

Trusted Computing. Sounds great. Doesn't it?

The industry's interpretation of the Trusted Computing idea looks quite similar,
aiming at the same, to fight threats and make computing trustworthy;

The main difference is, that you cannot decide by your own what is trustworthy
and what is not, because they already decided for you, and they already decided
not to trust you;

So, if they don't trust you, why should you trust them?

Trusted Computing. Sounds great. Is it?

No more.

   The quest for creation not limited to the styling of surfaces has led to a
