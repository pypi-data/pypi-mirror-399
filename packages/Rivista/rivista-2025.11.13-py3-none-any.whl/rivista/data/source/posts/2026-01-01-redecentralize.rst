.. summary:
   Taking back the net…
   We have had enough of digital monopolies and surveillance capitalism.
   We want a world that works for everyone, just like the original intention of
   the internet.
   We seek a world of open platforms and protocols with real choices of
   applications and services for people. We care about privacy, transparency and
   autonomy.
   Our organisations and tools should fundamentally be accountable and
   resilient.

What is Redecentralize?
-----------------------

Redecentralize is an independent, volunteer-driven organisation promoting the
decentralisation of our digital technology. By connecting technologists with
media, policymakers and the wider public, we support projects that work on open,
accountable technologies. We strive for freedom of choice and to reduce the
power of, and our collective dependence on, big tech corporations.

We care about autonomy and privacy, diversity and inclusivity, sustainability
and resilience. We strive for technology that respects these values, and brings
power back to individuals and communities.

Redecentralize is registered as a not-for-profit organisation in the UK — while
aiming for its scope and reach to be as international as the internet.

Why (re)decentralise?
---------------------

Despite its open design and democratic ideals, recent years have shown a
creeping centralisation of the internet, leading to a handful of gigantic
corporations directing its future. This unaccountable corporate capture of our
social and digital infrastructure has already led to:

Less choice and diversity of products and services, as big tech companies keep
users locked in through network effects and closed protocols.

An imbalance of power due to that lack of choice — leading people to accept
unfair terms and conditions and exploitative business models, in order to avoid
being left out.

Privacy breaches, unethical data use, addiction, discrimination and political
subversion. Our most successful digital business models depend on behavioural
data exploitation, with companies being incentivised to profile and manipulate
users rather than serve them.

We believe technology can and should serve and empower people, not exploit them.
We want and deserve better!

How does Redecentralize address these issues?
---------------------------------------------

Luckily, we are not alone. Many people are pursuing benevolent ways to create,
use and govern technology. Hundreds of projects are committed to standardise
formats and protocols, develop open source software and hardware, explain the
problems and promote solutions.

Redecentralize promotes, connects and facilitates these efforts — because
tackling monopoly power and exploitative business models requires us to work
together.

We do not side with one specific party, project or protocol, but support the
open internet ecosystem as a whole. We bring together technologists,
policymakers, journalists and the wider public to learn from each other and
collaborate.

Redecentralize focusses on three core areas of complementary work:

1. Support and grow the decentralised internet ecosystem
2. Raise awareness of problems and their underlying causes
3. Advocate for decentralisation to inform supportive policy and regulation

How it started
--------------

Redecentralize.org started with a small band of volunteers (Francis Irving,
Irina Bolychevsky and Ross Jones) in the wake of the Snowden revelations in June
2013. In the tumult about unaccountable mass surveillance and undermined
security, we wanted to promote and connect the amazing projects that could
contribute structural solutions, being quietly worked on by people who cared
about privacy, resilience and user-control. For the curious, here is an
interview with us from those early days.

We started with surveying the field, interviewing project founders, and hosting
meet-ups to foster a movement of decentralisers. Since we started and in between
jobs, lives and conferences, we have managed to:

* `Interview over 20 founders <Interview over 20 founders>`_ of
  decentralisation-related projects;
* Organise two sold out conferences in
  `2015 <https://redecentralize.org/events/2015-conference/>`_ and
  `2019 <https://redecentralize.org/events/2019-conference/>`_ as well as dozens
  of meet-ups;
* Maintain a list of hundreds of
  `alternative internet projects <https://github.com/redecentralize/alternative-internet>`_;
* Promote decentralisation all over the world with keynotes,
  `talks <https://youtube.com/watch?v=UPAiwFhlMhk>`_,
  `blogposts <https://redecentralize.org/blog/2018/08/18/theres-more-to-decentralisation-than-blockchains-and-bitcoin.html>`_,
  workshops and
  `interviews <https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-mission-to-decentralize-the-internet>`_;
* Update thousands of subscribers about decentralisation efforts, events, news,
  progress with newsletters and monthly
  `digests <https://redecentralize.org/redigest/>`_; and
* Review decentralised apps that are readily usable.

We called our movement “**Re** decentralize” to remind people about the open and
democratic ideals of the early internet, which helped it flourish.

Join us

There is still so much to do! From curating resources or writing guides for
local-first, open-source, encrypted tech, to holding discussions and working
groups around policy and better business models, to running meet-ups and events
— there is more to do than we have time for.

If you want to volunteer, collaborate in some way, or have a project (idea) that
could fit in, please write us at hello@redecentralize.org telling a bit about
yourself and what you are interested in doing.
