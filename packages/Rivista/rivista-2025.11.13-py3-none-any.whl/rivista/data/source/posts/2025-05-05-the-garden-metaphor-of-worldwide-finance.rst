.. summary:
   The Garden Metaphor is a parable to modern worldwide finance.
   The author of the metaphor, beautifully establishes the conclusion of how
   industries and people in our world are manipulated in a similar fashion to how a
   gardener arranges the growth of plants.
   People who are authorized to declare money and define its value (i.e. print
   money without guarantying or supporting it by precious metals, commodities,
   or other substantial resources), do not need to send armed forces or
   violently suppress dissent, in order to enforce their will on others, but
   rather to “inject”, so to speak, money into areas which they are interested
   to influence their will upon.

.. epigraph::

   After conquering so much of the world, did the British Royals really just
   ‘give back’ their empire? Or is the worldwide process of ‘decolonisation’
   which we are taught in school, merely a smokescreen for an updated
   implementation of their existing control grid, now enforced through subtler
   means?

----------

In my garden, thanks to my hose and an awning which prevents outside rain coming
in, I hold an effective monopoly on the distribution of water.

With my finger on the trigger, I can decide which plants get water and which
do not. I can choose which areas of the garden thrive, and which die a slow
death.

In general, the plants which I do aim my hose at will flourish, along with any
vegetation underneath or nearby which will inevitably benefit from incidental
runoff.

By dividing the garden into separate pots and beds, I can even restrict the
extent to which plants can use their underground root networks to share water
among themselves.

It should go without saying, that my goal in watering these plants is not to
somehow gain or accumulate more water from this process; any more than a
farmer's goal is to gain more animal feed by pouring it into a horse-pen, or a
parent's goal is to gain more candy by handing it to a child.

The water, from my point of view, is a means to an end. It is a tool of control,
and not something I am seeking to accumulate more of, for some arbitrary reason.

In fact, the cost of the water is inconsequential to me, and my access to it
near instant and effectively unlimited; as we all know, it is through the
strategic distribution of that water, from a higher position than the plants,
that I achieved my real goal, which is to influence the growth of those plants,
and to shape the overall makeup of the garden.

With the power to create funds from nothing, economies all over the world can be
manipulated in a similar fashion.

When funds are issued into the system, money flows; and as it moves, more people
have money to spend, more transactions occur, and more people are inspired to
start certain kinds of businesses, or proactively find ways to get some of that
money for themselves.

The economy is doing well, people would say; the industries or particular
organizations where those funds are injected, whether it be by loans, or
government grants, private investment, or whatever, will flourish; as the
recipients of those funds use their newfound bank deposits to rent office space,
or hire employees, or pay vendors, or buy coffees from the cafe downstairs, these
funds radiate outwards, and anyone around them or their industry gains a flow on
benefit from that initial fund injection.

It is no surprise that those who work in high level banking, tend to be wealthy.
They are closer to the injection site, and upstream of most trickled-down
recipients of these funds.

Of course, people then, naturally, observe which businesses and industries seem
to have money, and become quickly inspired to cater to those businesses.

This is akin to the gold rush effect, and as such, booming industries grow
around them.

As you can imagine, it does not particularly matter whether or not the initial
recipients of these funds are actually viable businesses, in the traditional
sense.

You will notice that many of the most successful tech businesses are expected to
and do lose money for many years, gunning for the seemingly outside chance of
achieving a defensible monopoly through a winner-takes-all business model.

This all seems to make some sense in retrospect, but how many people do you know
that would be interested in investing millions of dollars in a business model
that consistently lost hundreds of millions of dollars, sometimes over a
billion, every year for nearly a decade?

Just as in **the garden metaphor**, with unlimited money in the money hose, the
eventual success of chosen companies, along with anyone connected to them, is
almost a foregone conclusion, because the holder of the money hose has deemed it
so.

Even a distinct lack of public interest in the goods and services being offered
can be overcome with years and years of relentless funding.

Just as unproductive or uncompetitive industries can be maintained and even
expanded with never-ending grants and subsidies.

Just as cities can be built in the desert, industries can be created and
promoted with ongoing strategic injections of funds, or they can be left to die
through the subsequent withdrawal of those funds.

Also, by financial institutions attaching requirements and strings to the
issuance of that money, however implausible the reasons provided, mass behaviour
can effectively be dictated in a flow-on manner throughout the entire corporate
system, and beyond.

With all of this in mind, one can imagine how it may be possible, despite us
being in a supposedly chaotic, volatile, unpredictable world, for certain trends
to march on unimpeded, progressing in an orderly fashion, year after year, until
they eventually take on the appearance of being inescapable, unarguable, and
perhaps even inevitable.

These gradual shifts, with enough strategic injections and system-wide
incentives in place, finally manage to catch-on, despite their initial economic
non-viability, and without any groundswell of people demanding, or even being
particularly interested in them, in the first place.

So, just as I can force non-natvie plants, in my garden, to grow despite them
having no business surviving in my geographic location climate; so, too, can the
issuance of funds shape world economies, for the most part, however they see
fit.
