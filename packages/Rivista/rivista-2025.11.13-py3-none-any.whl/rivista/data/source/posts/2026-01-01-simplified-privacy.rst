There is a crisis for privacy, as the rise of AI is exacerbating the already bad
problem of browser fingerprinting.

Concern
-------

People perceive there are these different websites, when, in reality, there is a
handful of problematic organizations that foist their presence over millions of
sites, under different domains.  The vast majority of browsers are immediately
vulnerable, such as LibreWolf and Brave.  And Tor Browser with JavaScript
blocking breaks many websites.

Pseudo
------

Even worse, some companies look to abuse the lack of knowledge of the public,
and promote "spoofing" extensions or browsers.  That supposed spoofing is
utterly ineffective, as audible and visual verification systems (i.e. so called
"captcha") force software and devices to render graphics compared to the real
one.  In fact, one of the most popular spoofing extensions Chameleon
automatically excludes (i.e. whitelists) several problematic organizations,
which means that identities are disclosed to them, when utilizing Chameleon.

Restriction
-----------

Automated machine-learning systems (i.e. AI, so called) can sift through large
amounts of data, and determine your entire life.  And a single organization
which measures connectivity and loading speed is a significant issue because
that single organization is serving lots of different sites from the same CDN
server by location.

Even if under some situations enough ECMAScript (i.e. JavaScript) scripts are
blocked to prevent identity disclosure, some problematic organizations haze
people with delays, increased number of checks (i.e. "captcha"), and
restrictions to sites.

HydraVeil
---------

Since having different browsers with different IP addresses might be difficult
to manage, HydraVeil simplifies this process by having a secondary Linux
operating system built-in, an automatic VPN IP for each browser, and a realistic
screen size with a secondary isolated graphical environment.  It automatically
matches the timezone of the environment with your IP address, to avoid
problematic organizations from hazing or restricting access.

Conclusion
----------

In a single click, HydraVeil empowers users to launch realistic browser
fingerprint profiles, to isolate the pieces of their life privately and
securely.
