.. type: text

XMPP is the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, a set of open
technologies for instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video
calls, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and
generalized routing of XML data.

XMPP was originally developed in the Jabber open-source community to provide an
open, decentralized alternative to the closed instant messaging services at that
time. XMPP offers several key advantages over such services:

Open
````

The XMPP protocols are free, open, public, and easily understandable; in
addition, multiple implementations exist in the form of clients, servers, server
components, and code libraries.

Standard
````````

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has formalized the core XML streaming
protocols as an approved instant messaging and presence technology. The XMPP
specifications were published as RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 in 2004, and the XMPP
Standards Foundation continues to publish many XMPP Extension Protocols. In 2011
the core RFCs were revised, resulting in the most up-to-date specifications (RFC
6120, RFC 6121, and RFC 7622).

Proven
``````

The first Jabber/XMPP technologies were developed by Jeremie Miller in 1998 and
are now quite stable; hundreds of developers are working on these technologies,
there are tens of thousands of XMPP servers running on the Internet today, and
millions of people use XMPP for instant messaging through various public
services and XMPP deployments at organizations worldwide.

Decentralized
`````````````

The architecture of the XMPP network is similar to email; as a result, anyone
can run their own XMPP server, enabling individuals and organizations to take
control of their communications experience.

Secure
``````

Any XMPP server may be isolated from the public network (e.g., on a company
intranet) and robust security using SASL and TLS has been built into the core
XMPP specifications. In addition, the XMPP developer community is actively
working on end-to-end encryption to raise the security bar even further.

Extensible
``````````

Using the power of XML, anyone can build custom functionality on top of the core
protocols; to maintain interoperability, common extensions are published in the
XEP series, but such publication is not required and organizations can maintain
their own private extensions if so desired.

Flexible
````````

XMPP applications beyond IM include network management, content syndication,
collaboration tools, file sharing, gaming, remote systems monitoring, internet
services, lightweight middleware, cloud computing, and much more.

Diverse
```````

A wide range of companies and open-source projects use XMPP to build and deploy
real-time applications and services; you will never get “locked in” when you use
XMPP technologies.

including links to specifications, implementations, tutorials, and
special-purpose discussion venues.

Conclusion
``````````

XMPP in general is an open and standardized protocol for real time communication.

Anyone can host their own server and communicate freely with each other, just
like with email and just like email the used addresses are of the form
“name@domain.tld”.

People can use different apps and services, such as Monal, from a single but
also multiple accounts. This serves a decentral and sovereign infrastructure and
digital communication on the internet but also offers many potential for
innovation.
