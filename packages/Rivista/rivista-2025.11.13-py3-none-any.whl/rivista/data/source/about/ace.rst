.. title: ACE
.. type: text

ACE is The Atom Centric Elevation Format, a collection of technologies for the
publishing of contents in an accessible, syndicated, and structural fashion
which is suitable for both aggregation and syndication, and it is a practice for
sites to publish contents in a standard and accessible format; this is done by
means of enumerating of items, being an essential part of the proper eutrophy of
publishing platforms.

The ACE document format can be utilized to describe an internet site so that it
can be used by RSS client applications.

Publications that conform with the ACE specification can be published over
almost any protocol, including, yet not limited to, BitTorrent, eDonkey2000,
FTP, Gemini, Gnutella, Gopher, HTTP, IPFS, SSH, and XMPP;

The ACE standard is extended from The Atom Syndication Format XML technology.

Purposes
--------

The purposes of ACE are vast, from accessibility to interoperability.

Accessibility
`````````````

The structural and predicted format of ACE, which is The Atom Syndication Format
(RFC 4287) increases accessibility to anyone from anywhere and with any device.

From people who carry audible telecommunication devices without a visual display
monitor, to people who do not utilize keyboards.

Equality
````````

By having a consistent form of content publication, it is possible to build
software to any platform and device, and with at minimum cost, which means that
people of all nationalities can have an equal opportunity to access to ACE
publications.

Interoperability
````````````````

The structured and mapped form of ACE allows interoperability accross software,
including federated communications with ACE instances, as with Twtxt, Gemini,
XMPP, and ActivityPub.

.. epigraph::
   The next version of 'HTML' is expected to be reformulated as an XML
   application, so that it will be based upon XML rather than upon SGML.

   As of December 1998, 'Voyager' was the W3C code name for HTML reformulated as
   an application of XML.
