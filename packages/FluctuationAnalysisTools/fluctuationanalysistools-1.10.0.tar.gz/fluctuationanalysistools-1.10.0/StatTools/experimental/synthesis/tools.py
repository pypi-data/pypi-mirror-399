def adjust_hurst_to_range(signal: np.ndarray) -> tuple[np.ndarray, int]:
    """
    Adjusts the Hurst exponent of a signal to fall within the range [0.5, 1.5]
    using cumulative sums and differences.

    The function uses mathematical transformations:
    - Cumulative sum (np.cumsum) increases the Hurst exponent by ~1.
    - Differencing (np.diff) decreases the Hurst exponent by ~1.

    Parameters:
        signal (array_like): Input 1D signal whose Hurst exponent needs adjustment

    Returns:
        adjusted_signal (ndarray): Signal with Hurst exponent adjusted to the target range
        applied_steps (int): Number of transformation steps applied:
            - Positive: number of cumulative sums applied (Hurst increased)
            - Negative: number of differences applied (Hurst decreased)
            - Zero: no transformation needed

    Notes:
        - For H > 1.5: applies differencing to reduce Hurst exponent.
        - For H < 0.5: applies cumulative sums to increase Hurst exponent.
        - The transformation follows approximate relationship:
          H_transformed ≈ H_original + applied_steps.

    """
    Reverses the Hurst exponent adjustment applied by adjust_hurst_to_range().

    Applies the inverse transformations to recover the original signal

    Parameters:
        adjusted_signal (array_like): Signal that was previously processed by adjust_hurst_to_range().
        applied_steps (int): Number of transformation steps that were originally applied.

    Returns:

    Notes:
        - If applied_steps was negative (differencing applied originally),
          applies cumulative sums to reconstruct the signal.
        - If applied_steps was positive (cumulative sums applied originally),
          applies differencing to reconstruct the signal.

          multiple differencing operations were applied.
