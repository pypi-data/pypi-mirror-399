## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create datasets with controlled statistical properties (Hurst exponent, long-term dependencies) including:
  - Kasdin method for fractional Brownian noise (Kasdin, N. J. (1995). Discrete simulation of colored noise and stochastic processes and 1/f/sup /spl alpha// power law noise generation.).
  - FFT-based N-dimensional fractional Brownian motion (fBm) generator (Timmer, J., & Koenig, M. (1995). On generating power law noise).
- **Fluctuation Analysis**: Perform various fluctuation analysis methods including:
  - Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)
  - Detrended Partial Cross-Correlation Analysis (DPCCA)
  - Standard Fluctuation Analysis (FA)
  - SVD-based DFA
  - Multidimensional DFA
  - Quantitative Signal Analysis (QSS)
- **Research Tools**: Support scientific research in complex systems exhibiting long-range correlations
- **Performance Optimized**: Multi-threaded implementations with C++ extensions for large datasets

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- C++ compiler (Mac and Windows packages contains precompiled binaries)

### Generating Synthetic Data

```python
from StatTools.generators import generate_fbn
import numpy as np

# Create a dataset with Hurst exponent H = 0.8 using the unified interface
hurst = 0.8
length = 1440

# Generate fractional Brownian noise using the default Kasdin method
fbn_series = generate_fbn(hurst=hurst, length=length)
print(f"Generated fBn series with shape: {fbn_series.shape}")
```

### Analyzing Time Series

#### Detrended Fluctuation Analysis

```python
from StatTools.generators import generate_fbn
from StatTools.analysis.dfa import dfa
from StatTools.analysis.utils import analyse_zero_cross_ff
import numpy as np

h = 0.7  # choose Hurst parameter
length = 6000  # vector's length

# Generate synthetic data using modern unified interface
trajectory = generate_fbn(hurst=h, length=length, method="kasdin").flatten()

# Analyze using functional-style DFA interface
s_vals, f2_vals = dfa(trajectory, degree=2)

# Calculate Hurst exponent from fluctuation function
f_vals = np.sqrt(f2_vals).reshape(1, -1)  # Convert F^2(s) to F(s) and reshape for analysis
s_vals_2d = s_vals.reshape(1, -1)  # Reshape scales to 2D array
hurst_result, _ = analyse_zero_cross_ff(f_vals, s_vals_2d)
hurst_exponent = hurst_result.slopes[0].value

print(f"Estimated H: {hurst_exponent:.3f} (Expected: {h:.3f})")
```
