        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                               Version 3, 29 June 2007
        
         Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        
         Preamble
        
        The GNU Lesser General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
        software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to permit
        linking with non-(L)GPLed software.
        
        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
        to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU Lesser General Public
        License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
        software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
        
        This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License applies to certain
        programs only, and not to any other program; by contrast, the ordinary
        GNU General Public License applies to a wider range of programs.  You
        can apply the GNU General Public License to your programs, but
        companies, organizations and other parties that distribute software
        packages that include, as part of them, some covered works, may wish to
        use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of the ordinary GNU
        General Public License.  The GNU Lesser General Public License allows
        you to redistribute and modify the library, while allowing the
        non-library work to be distributed under terms of your choice, as long
        as these terms do not modify the library's terms.
        
        Terms and conditions
        
        0. Definitions.
        
        "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
        
        "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
        works, such as semiconductor masks.
        
        "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
        License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
        
        A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
        derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
        the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
        and/or translated into another language.
        
        "To modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
        in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
        exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
        earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
        
        "Source" form of a work means the preferred form for making modifications
        to it.  "Object" form means any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not
        limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and
        conversions to other media types.
        
        A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
        on the Program.
        
        "You" means any person who propagates or modifies a covered work.
        
        To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
        permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
        infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
        computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
        distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
        public, and in some countries other activities as well.
        
        To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
        parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
        a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
        
        1. Exception to section 0 of the GPL.
        
        The intent of this license is to permit linking a "work that uses the
        Library" with a "non-source" work that is proprietary.  Section 0
        of the GPL refers to the terms of the GPL as governing any "covered
        work"; the following exception grants permissions that would otherwise
        be restricted by the GPL.
        
        2. Basic permissions.
        
        All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
        copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
        conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
        permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
        covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
        content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
        rights to make, run and propagate covered works.
        
        3. Protecting users' legal rights from anti-circumvention law.
        
        No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
        measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11
        of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
        laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
        
        4. Conveying verbatim copies.
        
        You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
        receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
        appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
        keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
        non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
        and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
        
        5. Conveying modified source versions.
        
        You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
        produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
        terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
        conditions:
        
           a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
           it, and giving a relevant date.
        
           b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
           released under this License and any conditions added under section
           7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
           "keep intact all notices".
        
           c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
           License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
           License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
           additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
           regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives the
           recipient the rights to modify and propagate the work.
        
           d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each such interface
           must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program
           has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
           Notices, your work need not make them do so.
        
        6. Conveying non-source forms.
        
        You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
        sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
        Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of the
        following ways:
        
           a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
           (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
           Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
           used for software interchange.
        
           b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
           (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
           written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
           long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product, to
           give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
           Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
           covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
           used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
           reasonable cost of physically performing this distribution, or (2)
           access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
           charge.
        
           c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
           written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative
           is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
           received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
           subsection 6b.
        
           d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
           place (gratis or for a charge), and offering equivalent access to the
           Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
           further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
           Corresponding Source along with the object code.
        
           e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
           you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
           Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
           charge under subsection 6d.
        
        7. Additional terms.
        
        Additional permissions, restrictions and conditions may be stated in
        this License; these are called "additional terms".  Additional terms
        that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though
        stated in this License, and are subject to its requirements.
        
        8. Termination.
        
        You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
        provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
        modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
        this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
        paragraph of section 11).
        
        9. Acceptance not required for having copies.
        
        You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
        copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
        solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
        copy likewise does not require acceptance.
        
        10. Automatic licensing of downstream recipients.
        
        Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
        receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
        propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
        for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
        
        11. Patents.
        
        A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
        License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
        work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

# onixpy - ONIX for Books Library

[![License: LGPL-3.0-or-later](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-LGPL--3.0--or--later-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html)
[![CI](https://github.com/hodeinavarro/onixpy/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hodeinavarro/onixpy/actions) [![Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/hodeinavarro/onixpy/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/hodeinavarro/onixpy) [![Python 3.10+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10%2B-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

A Python library for parsing and working with ONIX for Books metadata (publishing industry standard). Built with Pydantic for type-safe data models.

## Features

- **ONIX 3.1 Support** - Parse and create ONIX 3.1 messages with full specification coverage
- **Type-Safe Models** - Pydantic v2 models with comprehensive type annotations
- **Dual Format Support** - Parse from and serialize to both XML and JSON formats
- **Reference & Short Tags** - Support for both reference names (`ONIXMessage`) and short tags (`ONIXmessage`)
- **Smart Model Behavior** - Constructors accept snake_case field names, validate by field name, and serialize using XML aliases
- **Code List Validation** - 30+ built-in ONIX code lists with automatic validation
- **RNG Schema Validation** - Validate messages against RELAX NG schema
- **Comprehensive Block Coverage** - Models for all major ONIX blocks (DescriptiveDetail, PublishingDetail, RelatedMaterial, etc.)

## Installation

```bash
pip install onixpy
```

## Quick Start

### Creating an ONIX Message

```python
from onix import ONIXMessage, Header, Product, ProductIdentifier, Sender

# Create a complete message
message = ONIXMessage(
    release="3.1",
    Header=Header(
        Sender=Sender(sender_name="MyPublisher"),
        SentDateTime="20231201T120000Z",
    ),
    Product=[
        Product(
            RecordReference="com.mypublisher.001",
            NotificationType="03",  # Notification confirmed
            ProductIdentifier=[
                ProductIdentifier(
                    ProductIDType="15",  # ISBN-13
                    IDValue="9780000000001"
                )
            ],
        ),
    ],
)
```

### Parsing ONIX

```python
from onix.parsers import json_to_message, xml_to_message

# From JSON (file path, dict, or iterable)
message = json_to_message("/path/to/message.json")
message = json_to_message({"header": {...}, "products": [...]})

# From XML (file path, string, Element, or iterable)
message = xml_to_message("/path/to/message.xml")
message = xml_to_message("<ONIXMessage>...</ONIXMessage>")

# Using short tag names
message = json_to_message(data, short_names=True)
message = xml_to_message(xml_string, short_names=True)
```

### Serializing ONIX

```python
from onix.parsers import message_to_json, message_to_xml_string, save_xml, save_json

# To JSON string
json_str = message_to_json(message)
json_str = message_to_json(message, short_names=True)  # Use short tags

# To XML string
xml_str = message_to_xml_string(message)
xml_str = message_to_xml_string(message, short_names=True)  # Use short tags

# Save to files
save_json(message, "/path/to/output.json")
save_xml(message, "/path/to/output.xml")
```

### Working with Code Lists

```python
from onix.lists import get_list, get_code, list_available

# Get all available list numbers
available = list_available()  # [1, 2, 5, 9, 12, 15, ...]

# Get a complete code list
list_5 = get_list(5)  # Product identifier type
print(list_5.heading)  # "Product identifier type"

# Get a specific code entry
isbn_13 = get_code(5, "15")
print(isbn_13.heading)  # "ISBN-13"
print(isbn_13.notes)  # Additional information about the code

# Access code lists by name
from onix.lists import ProductIdentifierType, NameIdentifierType
```

### RNG Schema Validation

```python
from onix.validation import validate_onix_message, validate_xml_element
from onix.parsers import message_to_xml

# Validate a message
message = ONIXMessage(...)
is_valid, errors = validate_onix_message(message)
if not is_valid:
    for error in errors:
        print(f"Validation error: {error}")

# Validate raw XML
xml_element = message_to_xml(message)
is_valid, errors = validate_xml_element(xml_element)
```

# Run all tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src/onix --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
uv run pytest tests/core/         # Core model tests
uv run pytest tests/parsers/      # Parser tests
uv run pytest tests/validation/   # Validation tests

# Run with markers
uv run pytest -m "not slow"       # Skip slow tests
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Lint and format with ruff
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .

# Type checking with ty (experimental)
uv run ty check
```

### Generating Code Lists

```bash
# Generate a new code list from ONIX specification
cd scripts
uv run python generate_codelist.py <list_number>

# Example
uv run python generate_codelist.py 44
```

## API Design Principles

- **Reference names by default**: All parsers/serializers use ONIX reference tag names (e.g., `ONIXMessage`, `Header`). Short names require explicit `short_names=True`.
- **Strict validation**: Code list values are validated against their respective lists. Invalid codes raise `ValidationError`.
- **Field aliases**: Pydantic `Field(alias=...)` definitions are the single source of truth for XML tag/field name mapping.
