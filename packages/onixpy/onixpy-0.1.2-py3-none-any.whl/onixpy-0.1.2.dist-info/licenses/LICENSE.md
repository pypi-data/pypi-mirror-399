GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble

The GNU Lesser General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to permit
linking with non-(L)GPLed software.

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU Lesser General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License applies to certain
programs only, and not to any other program; by contrast, the ordinary
GNU General Public License applies to a wider range of programs.  You
can apply the GNU General Public License to your programs, but
companies, organizations and other parties that distribute software
packages that include, as part of them, some covered works, may wish to
use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of the ordinary GNU
General Public License.  The GNU Lesser General Public License allows
you to redistribute and modify the library, while allowing the
non-library work to be distributed under terms of your choice, as long
as these terms do not modify the library's terms.

Terms and conditions

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated into another language.

"To modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

"Source" form of a work means the preferred form for making modifications
to it.  "Object" form means any form resulting from mechanical
transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not
limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and
conversions to other media types.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

"You" means any person who propagates or modifies a covered work.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

1. Exception to section 0 of the GPL.

The intent of this license is to permit linking a "work that uses the
Library" with a "non-source" work that is proprietary.  Section 0
of the GPL refers to the terms of the GPL as governing any "covered
work"; the following exception grants permissions that would otherwise
be restricted by the GPL.

2. Basic permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights to make, run and propagate covered works.

3. Protecting users' legal rights from anti-circumvention law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

4. Conveying verbatim copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

5. Conveying modified source versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
   it, and giving a relevant date.

   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
   released under this License and any conditions added under section
   7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
   "keep intact all notices".

   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
   License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
   License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
   additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
   regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives the
   recipient the rights to modify and propagate the work.

   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each such interface
   must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program
   has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
   Notices, your work need not make them do so.

6. Conveying non-source forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of the
following ways:

   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
   Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
   used for software interchange.

   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
   written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
   long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product, to
   give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
   Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
   covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
   used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
   reasonable cost of physically performing this distribution, or (2)
   access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
   charge.

   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
   written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative
   is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
   received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
   subsection 6b.

   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
   place (gratis or for a charge), and offering equivalent access to the
   Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
   further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
   Corresponding Source along with the object code.

   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
   you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
   Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
   charge under subsection 6d.

7. Additional terms.

Additional permissions, restrictions and conditions may be stated in
this License; these are called "additional terms".  Additional terms
that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though
stated in this License, and are subject to its requirements.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

9. Acceptance not required for having copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
copy likewise does not require acceptance.

10. Automatic licensing of downstream recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
