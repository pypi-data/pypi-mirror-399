## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation][]. In particular, the

- [Tutorials][], specially
    - [A demo](https://drvi.readthedocs.io/latest/tutorials/external/general_pipeline.html) of how to train DRVI and interpret the latent dimensions.
- [Api documentation][], specially
    - [DRVI Model](https://drvi.readthedocs.io/latest/api/generated/drvi.model.DRVI.html)
    - [DRVI utility functions (tools)](https://drvi.readthedocs.io/latest/api/tools.html)
    - [DRVI plotting functions](https://drvi.readthedocs.io/latest/api/plotting.html)

## System requirements

We recommend running DRVI on a recent Linux distribution.
DRVI is actively tested on the latest LTS version of Ubuntu (currently 24.04 LTS).

<!-- TODO: remove ubuntu version later -->

For optimal performance, we highly recommend using a GPU with CUDA capabilities.
While CPU-based systems are supported, GPU-powered systems are strongly recommended for optimal performance.

## Installation

You need to have Python (versions 3.10 to 3.14 supported) installed on your system. If you don't have
Python installed, we recommend installing [uv][].

There are several alternative options to install drvi:

<!-- TODO: remove install time! -->

1. Install the latest release of `drvi-py` from [PyPI][], which should take around two minutes:

```bash
pip install drvi-py
```

1. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/theislab/drvi.git@main
```

Please be sure to install a version of [PyTorch][pytorch-home] that is compatible with your GPU.
Dependencies are installed automatically, please take a look at the versions for different dependencies in `pyproject.toml` if needed.

[pytorch-home]: https://pytorch.org/

## Release notes

See the [changelog][changelog].

## Contact

For questions and help requests, you can reach out in the [scverse discourse][].
If you found a bug, please use the [issue tracker][].
