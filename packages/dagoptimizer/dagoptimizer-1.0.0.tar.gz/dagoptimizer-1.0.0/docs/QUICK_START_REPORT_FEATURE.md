### Key Sections

#### Metrics Table Example
```
Metric                    | Original | Optimized
-------------------------|----------|----------
Nodes                    | 50       | 47
Edges                    | 120      | 78
Redundancy Ratio         | 0.3500   | 0.1154
Efficiency Score         | 0.6234   | 0.8012
Topological Complexity   | 8        | 6
```

#### Mathematical Formulas
- Efficiency Score: `E = [(1 - R) + (1 - D) + C] / 3`
- Redundancy Ratio: `R = (|TC| - |TR|) / |E|`
- Compactness Score: `C = 1 - (|E| / (n(n-1)/2))`
- Degree Entropy: `H = -Σ(p_i × log₂(p_i))`

## Example Output

### Abstract (Sample)
```
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of Directed 
Acyclic Graph (DAG) optimization techniques applied to a 
graph with 50 nodes and 120 edges. Through the application 
of transitive reduction and node equivalence merging 
algorithms, we achieved a 35.0% reduction in edge count 
while preserving graph semantics. The optimization resulted 
in a 28.5% improvement in overall efficiency score and a 
67.2% reduction in redundancy ratio.

Keywords: Directed Acyclic Graph, Graph Optimization, 
Transitive Reduction, Node Merging, Computational 
Complexity, Network Analysis
