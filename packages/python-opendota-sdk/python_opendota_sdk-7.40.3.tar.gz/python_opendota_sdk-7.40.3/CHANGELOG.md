## [7.40.3] - 2025-12-30

### Added
- `wait_for_replay` parameter for `get_match()` - wait for OpenDota to parse a match
  - Returns `ParseTask` that can be awaited or iterated for progress updates
  - Useful for recently completed matches that haven't been parsed yet
  - Example: `match = await client.get_match(match_id, wait_for_replay=True)`

### Fixed
- Type annotations for `get_match()` overloads now correctly handle both sync and async usage
