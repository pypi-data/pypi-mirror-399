"""
GPG encryption operations for protecting sensitive files.

Provides GPG public key encryption for age keys and other sensitive files.
The user's GPG key (identified by email) is used for encryption, and the
GPG agent caches the private key passphrase for decryption.

Key features:
- Public key encryption (uses recipient's GPG key)
- GPG agent handles passphrase caching automatically
- TTY handling for pinentry (GPG_TTY must be set)
- State detection (is file encrypted or not?)
- Atomic file operations
- Subprocess timeouts to prevent hanging
