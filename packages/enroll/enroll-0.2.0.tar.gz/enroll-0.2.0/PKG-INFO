# Enroll

<div align="center">

</div>

**enroll** inspects a Linux machine (Debian-like or RedHat-like) and generates Ansible roles/playbooks (and optionally inventory) for what it finds.

- Detects packages that have been installed.
- Detects package ownership of `/etc` files where possible
- Captures config that has **changed from packaged defaults** where possible (e.g dpkg conffile hashes + package md5sums when available).
- Also captures **service-relevant custom/unowned files** under `/etc/<service>/...` (e.g. drop-in config includes).
- Defensively excludes likely secrets (path denylist + content sniff + size caps).
- Captures non-system users and their SSH public keys.
- Captures miscellaneous `/etc` files it can't attribute to a package and installs them in an `etc_custom` role.
- Ditto for /usr/local/bin (for non-binary files) and /usr/local/etc
- Avoids trying to start systemd services that were detected as inactive during harvest.

---

## Mental model

`enroll` works in two phases:

1) **Harvest**: collect host facts + relevant files into a harvest bundle (`state.json` + harvested artifacts)
2) **Manifest**: turn that harvest into Ansible roles/playbooks (and optionally inventory)

Additionally, some other functionalities exist:

- **Diff**: compare two harvests and report what changed (packages/services/users/files) since the previous snapshot.
- **Single-shot mode**: run both harvest and manifest at once.

---

## Output modes: single-site vs multi-site (`--fqdn`)

`enroll manifest` (and `enroll single-shot`) support two distinct output styles.

### Single-site mode (default: *no* `--fqdn`)
Use when enrolling **one server** (or generating a “golden” role set you intend to reuse).

**Characteristics**
- Roles are more self-contained.
- Raw config files live in the role's `files/`.
- Template variables live in the role's `defaults/main.yml`.

### Multi-site mode (`--fqdn`)
Use when enrolling **several existing servers** quickly, especially if they differ.

**Characteristics**
- Roles are shared, host-specific state lives in inventory.
- Host inventory drives what gets managed (files/packages/services).
- Non-templated raw files live per-host under `inventory/host_vars/<fqdn>/<role>/.files/...`.

**Rule of thumb**
- “Make this one server reproducible/provisionable” → start with **single-site**
- “Get multiple already-running servers under management quickly” → use **multi-site**

---

## Subcommands

### `enroll harvest`
Harvest state about a host and write a harvest bundle.

**What it captures (high level)**
- Detected services + service-relevant packages
- “Manual” packages
- Changed-from-default config (plus related custom/unowned files under service dirs)
- Non-system users + SSH public keys
- Misc `/etc` that can't be attributed to a package (`etc_custom` role)
- Optional user-specified extra files/dirs via `--include-path` (emitted as an `extra_paths` role at manifest time)

**Common flags**
- Remote harvesting:
  - `--remote-host`, `--remote-user`, `--remote-port`
  - `--no-sudo` (if you don't want/need sudo)
- Sensitive-data behaviour:
  - default: tries to avoid likely secrets
  - `--dangerous`: disables secret-safety checks (see “Sensitive data” below)
- Encrypt bundles at rest:
  - `--sops <FINGERPRINT...>`: writes a single encrypted `harvest.tar.gz.sops` instead of a plaintext directory
- Path selection (include/exclude):
  - `--include-path <PATTERN>` (repeatable): add extra files/dirs to harvest (even from locations normally ignored, like `/home`). Still subject to secret-safety checks unless `--dangerous`.
  - `--exclude-path <PATTERN>` (repeatable): skip files/dirs even if they would normally be harvested.
  - Pattern syntax:
    - plain path: matches that file; directories match the directory + everything under it
    - glob (default): supports `*` and `**` (prefix with `glob:` to force)
    - regex: prefix with `re:` or `regex:`
  - Precedence: excludes win over includes.

---

### `enroll manifest`
Generate Ansible output from an existing harvest bundle.

**Inputs**
- `--harvest /path/to/harvest` (directory)
  or `--harvest /path/to/harvest.tar.gz.sops` (if using `--sops`)

**Output**
- In plaintext mode: an Ansible repo-like directory structure (roles/playbooks, and inventory in multi-site mode).
- In `--sops` mode: a single encrypted file `manifest.tar.gz.sops` containing the generated output.

**Common flags**
- `--fqdn <host>`: enables **multi-site** output style

---

### `enroll single-shot`
Convenience wrapper that runs **harvest → manifest** in one command.

Use this when you want “get me something workable ASAP”.

Supports the same general flags as harvest/manifest, including `--fqdn`, remote harvest flags, and `--sops`.

---

### `enroll diff`
Compare two harvest bundles and report what changed.

**What it reports**
- Packages added/removed
- Services enabled added/removed, plus key state changes
- Users added/removed, plus field changes (uid/gid/home/shell/groups, etc.)
- Managed files added/removed/changed (metadata + content hash changes where available)

**Inputs**
- `--old <harvest>` and `--new <harvest>` (directories or `state.json` paths)
- `--sops` when comparing SOPS-encrypted harvest bundles

**Output formats**
- `--format json` (default for webhooks)
- `--format markdown` / `--format text` (human-oriented)

**Notifications**
- Webhook:
  - `--webhook <url>`
  - `--webhook-format json|markdown|text`
  - `--webhook-header 'Header-Name: value'` (repeatable)
- Email (optional):
  - `--email-to <addr>` (plus optional SMTP/sendmail-related flags, depending on your install)

---

## Sensitive data

By default, `enroll` does **not** assume how you handle secrets in Ansible. It will attempt to avoid harvesting likely sensitive data (private keys, passwords, tokens, etc.). This can mean it skips some config files you may ultimately want to manage.

If you opt in to collecting everything:

### `--dangerous`
**WARNING:** disables “likely secret” safety checks. This can copy private keys, TLS key material, API tokens, database passwords, and other credentials into the harvest output **in plaintext**.

If you intend to keep harvests/manifests long-term (especially in git), strongly consider encrypting them at rest.

### Encrypt bundles at rest with `--sops`
`--sops` encrypts the harvest and/or manifest outputs into a single `.tar.gz.sops` file (GPG). This is for **storage-at-rest**, not for direct “Ansible SOPS inventory” workflows.

⚠️ Important: `manifest --sops` produces one encrypted file. You must decrypt + extract it before running `ansible-playbook`.

---

## JinjaTurtle integration (both modes)

If [JinjaTurtle](https://git.mig5.net/mig5/jinjaturtle) is installed, `enroll` can generate Jinja2 templates for ini/json/xml/toml-style config.

- Templates live in `roles/<role>/templates/...`
- Variables live in:
  - single-site: `roles/<role>/defaults/main.yml`
  - multi-site: `inventory/host_vars/<fqdn>/<role>.yml`

You can force it on with `--jinjaturtle` or disable with `--no-jinjaturtle`.

---

## How multi-site avoids “shared role breaks a host”

In multi-site mode, roles are **data-driven**. The role tasks are generic (“deploy the files listed for this host”, “install the packages listed for this host”, “apply systemd enable/start state listed for this host”). Host inventory decides what applies per-host, avoiding the classic “host2 adds config, host1 breaks” failure mode.

## Found a bug / have a suggestion?

My Forgejo doesn't currently support federation, so I haven't opened registration/login for issues.

Instead, email me (see `pyproject.toml`) or contact me on the Fediverse:

# Examples

## Harvest

### Local harvest
```bash
enroll harvest --out /tmp/enroll-harvest
```

### Remote harvest over SSH
```bash
enroll harvest --remote-host myhost.example.com --remote-user myuser --out /tmp/enroll-harvest
```

### Include paths (`--include-path`)
```bash
# Add a few dotfiles from /home (still secret-safe unless --dangerous)
enroll harvest --out /tmp/enroll-harvest --include-path '/home/*/.bashrc' --include-path '/home/*/.profile'
```

### Exclude paths (`--exclude-path`)
```bash
# Skip specific /usr/local/bin entries (or patterns)
enroll harvest --out /tmp/enroll-harvest --exclude-path '/usr/local/bin/docker-*' --exclude-path '/usr/local/bin/some-tool'
```

### Regex include
```bash
enroll harvest --out /tmp/enroll-harvest --include-path 're:^/home/[^/]+/\.config/myapp/.*$'
```

### `--dangerous`
```bash
enroll harvest --out /tmp/enroll-harvest --dangerous
```

### Remote + dangerous:
```bash
enroll harvest --remote-host myhost.example.com --remote-user myuser --dangerous
```

### `--sops` (encrypt at rest)
```bash
# Encrypted harvest bundle (writes /tmp/enroll-harvest/harvest.tar.gz.sops)
enroll harvest --out /tmp/enroll-harvest --dangerous --sops <FINGERPRINT(s)>
```

---

## Manifest

### Single-site (default: no --fqdn)
```bash
enroll manifest --harvest /tmp/enroll-harvest --out /tmp/enroll-ansible
```

### Multi-site (--fqdn)
```bash
enroll manifest --harvest /tmp/enroll-harvest --out /tmp/enroll-ansible --fqdn "$(hostname -f)"
```

### Manifest with `--sops`
```bash
# Generate encrypted manifest bundle (writes /tmp/enroll-ansible/manifest.tar.gz.sops)
enroll manifest --harvest /tmp/enroll-harvest/harvest.tar.gz.sops --out /tmp/enroll-ansible --sops <FINGERPRINT(s)>

# Decrypt/extract the manifest bundle, then run Ansible from inside ./manifest/
cd /tmp/enroll-ansible
sops -d manifest.tar.gz.sops | tar -xzvf -
cd manifest
```

---

## Single-shot

```bash
enroll single-shot --harvest /tmp/enroll-harvest --out /tmp/enroll-ansible --fqdn "$(hostname -f)"
```

Remote single-shot (run harvest over SSH, then manifest locally):
```bash
enroll single-shot --remote-host myhost.example.com --remote-user myuser   --harvest /tmp/enroll-harvest --out /tmp/enroll-ansible --fqdn "myhost.example.com"
```

---

## Diff

### Compare two harvest directories
```bash
enroll diff --old /path/to/harvestA --new /path/to/harvestB --format json
```

### Diff + webhook notify
```bash
enroll diff   --old /path/to/golden/harvest   --new /path/to/new/harvest   --webhook https://nr.mig5.net/forms/webhooks/xxxx   --webhook-format json   --webhook-header 'X-Enroll-Secret: xxxx'
```

`diff` mode also supports email sending and text or markdown format, as well as `--exit-code` mode to trigger a return code of 2 (useful for crons or CI)

---

## Run Ansible

### Single-site
```bash
ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local /tmp/enroll-ansible/playbook.yml
```

### Multi-site (--fqdn)
```bash
ansible-playbook /tmp/enroll-ansible/playbooks/"$(hostname -f)".yml
```

## Configuration file

As can be seen above, there are a lot of powerful 'permutations' available to all four subcommands.

Sometimes, it can be easier to store them in a config file so you don't have to remember them!

Enroll supports reading an ini-style file of all the arguments for each subcommand.

### Location of the config file

The path the config file can be specified with `-c` or `--config` on the command-line. Otherwise,
Enroll will look for `./enroll.ini`, `./.enroll.ini` (in the current working directory),
`~/.config/enroll/enroll.ini` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/enroll/enroll.ini`).

You may also pass `--no-config` if you deliberately want to ignore the config file even if it existed.

### Precedence

Highest wins:

 * Explicit CLI flags
 * INI config ([cmd], [enroll])
 * argparse defaults

### Example config file

Here is an example.

Whenever an argument on the command-line has a 'hyphen' in it, just be sure to change it to an underscore in the ini file.

```ini
[enroll]
# (future global flags may live here)

[harvest]
dangerous = false
include_path =
  /home/*/.bashrc
  /home/*/.profile
exclude_path = /usr/local/bin/docker-*, /usr/local/bin/some-tool
# remote_host = yourserver.example.com
# remote_user = you
# remote_port = 2222

[manifest]
# you can set defaults here too, e.g.
no_jinjaturtle = true
sops = 00AE817C24A10C2540461A9C1D7CDE0234DB458D

[single-shot]
# if you use single-shot, put its defaults here.
# It does not inherit those of the subsections above, so you
# may wish to repeat them here.
include_path = re:^/home/[^/]+/\.config/myapp/.*$
```
