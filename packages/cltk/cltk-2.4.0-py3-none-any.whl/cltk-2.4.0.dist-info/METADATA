The Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) is a Python library offering natural language processing (NLP) for pre-modern languages.

## Installation

For the CLTK's latest version:

```bash
pip install cltk
```

Optional extras

- GenAI (OpenAI-backed annotation):

```bash
pip install "cltk[openai]"
```

- Stanza (discriminative NLP backends powered by Stanford Stanza):

```bash
pip install "cltk[stanza]"
```

You can combine extras, for example:

```bash
pip install "cltk[openai,stanza]"

# or include local LLM support as well
pip install "cltk[openai,stanza,ollama]"
```

- Local LLMs via Ollama:

Install the optional extra and ensure an Ollama server is running locally:

```bash
pip install "cltk[ollama]"
```

By default, when using `backend='ollama'`, CLTK uses the model `llama3.1:8b`. To choose a different local model, pass the `model` parameter to `NLP(...)`, e.g. `qwen2.5:14b`, `gemma2:27b`, `llama3.1:70b`, or any Ollama model string.

### Choosing a model

- OpenAI backend (GenAI in the cloud):

```python
from cltk.nlp import NLP

# Default model is "gpt-5-mini" when backend='openai'
nlp = NLP('lati1261', backend='openai')

# Choose a specific model
nlp_big = NLP('lati1261', backend='openai', model='gpt-5')

# Requires OPENAI_API_KEY to be set in the environment
# (e.g., via a .env file or shell env var)
```

- Ollama backend (local LLMs):

```python
from cltk.nlp import NLP

# Default model is "llama3.1:8b" when backend='ollama'
nlp_local = NLP('lati1261', backend='ollama')

# Choose a specific local model (any installed/pullable Ollama model)
nlp_qwen = NLP('lati1261', backend='ollama', model='qwen2.5:14b')

# To use the hosted Ollama Cloud, set OLLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY
# and choose backend='ollama-cloud'. The same model strings apply.
```

For more information, see [Installation docs](https://docs.cltk.org/en/latest/installation.html) or, to install from source, [Development](https://docs.cltk.org/en/latest/development.html).

Pre-1.0 software remains available on the [branch v0.1.x](https://github.com/cltk/cltk/tree/v0.1.x) and docs at <https://legacy.cltk.org>. Install it with `pip install "cltk<1.0"`.

    abstract = "This paper announces version 1.0 of the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK), an NLP framework for pre-modern languages. The vast majority of NLP, its algorithms and software, is created with assumptions particular to living languages, thus neglecting certain important characteristics of largely non-spoken historical languages. Further, scholars of pre-modern languages often have different goals than those of living-language researchers. To fill this void, the CLTK adapts ideas from several leading NLP frameworks to create a novel software architecture that satisfies the unique needs of pre-modern languages and their researchers. Its centerpiece is a modular processing pipeline that balances the competing demands of algorithmic diversity with pre-configured defaults. The CLTK currently provides pipelines, including models, for almost 20 languages.",
