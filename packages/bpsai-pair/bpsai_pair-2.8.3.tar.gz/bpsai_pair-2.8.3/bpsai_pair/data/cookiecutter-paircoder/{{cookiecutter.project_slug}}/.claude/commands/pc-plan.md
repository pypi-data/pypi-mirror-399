Show the current plan details.

Run:
```bash
bpsai-pair plan list
```

If there's an active plan, show its details:
```bash
bpsai-pair plan show <active-plan-id>
```

Then read `.paircoder/context/state.md` to find the current plan and summarize:
1. Plan title and status
2. Sprint breakdown with task counts
3. Progress (completed vs total points)
