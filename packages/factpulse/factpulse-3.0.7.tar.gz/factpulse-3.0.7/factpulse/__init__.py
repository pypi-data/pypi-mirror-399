    FactPulse REST API

     REST API for electronic invoicing in France: Factur-X, AFNOR PDP/PA, electronic signatures.  ## 🎯 Main Features  ### 📄 Factur-X Invoice Generation - **Formats**: XML only or PDF/A-3 with embedded XML - **Profiles**: MINIMUM, BASIC, EN16931, EXTENDED - **Standards**: EN 16931 (EU directive 2014/55), ISO 19005-3 (PDF/A-3), CII (UN/CEFACT) - **🆕 Simplified Format**: Generation from SIRET + auto-enrichment (Chorus Pro API + Business Search)  ### ✅ Validation and Compliance - **XML Validation**: Schematron (45 to 210+ rules depending on profile) - **PDF Validation**: PDF/A-3, Factur-X XMP metadata, electronic signatures - **VeraPDF**: Strict PDF/A validation (146+ ISO 19005-3 rules) - **Asynchronous Processing**: Celery support for heavy validations (VeraPDF)  ### 📡 AFNOR PDP/PA Integration (XP Z12-013) - **Flow Submission**: Send invoices to Partner Dematerialization Platforms - **Flow Search**: View submitted invoices - **Download**: Retrieve PDF/A-3 with XML - **Directory Service**: Company search (SIREN/SIRET) - **Multi-client**: Support for multiple PDP configs per user (stored credentials or zero-storage)  ### ✍️ PDF Electronic Signature - **Standards**: PAdES-B-B, PAdES-B-T (RFC 3161 timestamping), PAdES-B-LT (long-term archival) - **eIDAS Levels**: SES (self-signed), AdES (commercial CA), QES (QTSP) - **Validation**: Cryptographic integrity and certificate verification - **Certificate Generation**: Self-signed X.509 certificates for testing  ### 🔄 Asynchronous Processing - **Celery**: Asynchronous generation, validation and signing - **Polling**: Status tracking via `/tasks/{task_id}/status` - **No timeout**: Ideal for large files or heavy validations  ## 🔒 Authentication  All requests require a **JWT token** in the Authorization header: ``` Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN ```  ### How to obtain a JWT token?  #### 🔑 Method 1: `/api/token/` API (Recommended)  **URL:** `https://www.factpulse.fr/api/token/`  This method is **recommended** for integration in your applications and CI/CD workflows.  **Prerequisites:** Having set a password on your account  **For users registered via email/password:** - You already have a password, use it directly  **For users registered via OAuth (Google/GitHub):** - You must first set a password at: https://www.factpulse.fr/accounts/password/set/ - Once the password is created, you can use the API  **Request example:** ```bash curl -X POST https://www.factpulse.fr/api/token/ \\   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\   -d '{     \"username\": \"your_email@example.com\",     \"password\": \"your_password\"   }' ```  **Optional `client_uid` parameter:**  To select credentials for a specific client (PA/PDP, Chorus Pro, signing certificates), add `client_uid`:  ```bash curl -X POST https://www.factpulse.fr/api/token/ \\   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\   -d '{     \"username\": \"your_email@example.com\",     \"password\": \"your_password\",     \"client_uid\": \"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\"   }' ```  The `client_uid` will be included in the JWT and allow the API to automatically use: - AFNOR/PDP credentials configured for this client - Chorus Pro credentials configured for this client - Electronic signature certificates configured for this client  **Response:** ```json {   \"access\": \"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc...\",  // Access token (validity: 30 min)   \"refresh\": \"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc...\"  // Refresh token (validity: 7 days) } ```  **Advantages:** - ✅ Full automation (CI/CD, scripts) - ✅ Programmatic token management - ✅ Refresh token support for automatic access renewal - ✅ Easy integration in any language/tool  #### 🖥️ Method 2: Dashboard Generation (Alternative)  **URL:** https://www.factpulse.fr/dashboard/  This method is suitable for quick tests or occasional use via the graphical interface.  **How it works:** - Log in to the dashboard - Use the \"Generate Test Token\" or \"Generate Production Token\" buttons - Works for **all** users (OAuth and email/password), without requiring a password  **Token types:** - **Test Token**: 24h validity, 1000 calls/day quota (free) - **Production Token**: 7 days validity, quota based on your plan  **Advantages:** - ✅ Quick for API testing - ✅ No password required - ✅ Simple visual interface  **Disadvantages:** - ❌ Requires manual action - ❌ No refresh token - ❌ Less suited for automation  ### 📚 Full Documentation  For more information on authentication and API usage: https://www.factpulse.fr/documentation-api/
