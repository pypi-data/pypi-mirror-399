# Style Guidelines

**1. Voice & Tone**
- **Direct & Active:** "The sensor reads data." (Not: "Data is read by the sensor.")
- **Professional:** Avoid slang, emojis (except in alerts), or overly casual language.
- **Concise:** Cut fluff. If a sentence doesn't add information, delete it.

**2. Structure**
- **Hook:** Start with the *problem* or the *value*. Why should I care?
- **Concept:** Explain the "what" simply.
- **Example:** Show the code or diagram immediately.
- **Explanation:** Explain the "how" and "why" of the example.

**3. Formatting**
- Use **Bold** for UI elements, key terms, and emphasis.
- Use `Code` styling for file paths, variables, and terminal commands.
- Use Admonitions (`:::note`, `:::warning`) for side-notes, not main content.
