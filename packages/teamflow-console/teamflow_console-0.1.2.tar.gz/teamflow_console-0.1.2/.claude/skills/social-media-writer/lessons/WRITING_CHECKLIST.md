# Writing Checklist

Quality validation rules for every generated post.
Based on top creator research and proven viral structures.

## Pre-Publish Checklist

Every post MUST pass all checks before being returned.

---

## 1. Hook Validation (Critical)

### One-Liner Hook Check
- [ ] First line is a strong hook (grabs attention immediately)
- [ ] Hook is under 12 words
- [ ] Hook creates curiosity or states value
- [ ] No backstory in hook (get to the point)

### Good Hook Examples:
- "I just shipped my first CLI app."
- "Stop wasting time on free API keys."
- "Spent 4 hours debugging a race condition."
- "Big moment for me."

### Bad Hooks (Auto-Reject):
- "So today I wanted to share something..." (too slow)
- "I've been working on this for a while..." (backstory first)
- "Hey everyone, hope you're doing well..." (filler)

---

## 2. Content Validation

### Banned Words Check
- [ ] No marketing hype phrases (game-changing, revolutionary, groundbreaking)
- [ ] No engagement bait (you won't believe, stop scrolling)
- [ ] No tech bro clichés (crushing it, thought leader, ninja)
- [ ] No performative humility (humbled to announce, I don't mean to brag)
- [ ] No empty filler phrases (at the end of the day, needless to say)

### Auto-Reject If Any Of:
- "game-changing" OR "revolutionary" OR "groundbreaking"
- "paradigm shift" OR "quantum leap"
- "crushing it" OR "killing it" OR "smashed it"
- "thought leader" OR "visionary" OR "ninja"
- "humbled to announce" OR "I don't mean to brag"
- "you won't believe" OR "stop scrolling"
- "at the end of the day" OR "needless to say"

---

## 3. Sentence Structure (Updated for Performance)

### Length Check (Research-Based)
- [ ] Most sentences under 10 words (70%+)
- [ ] All sentences under 12 words (strict: <12 words performs 20% better)
- [ ] No sentence over 15 words (auto-reject if found)
- [ ] One idea per sentence (no compound sentences with 3+ clauses)

### Simple English Check
- [ ] Words are simple (non-native friendly)
- [ ] No complex vocabulary
- [ ] Active voice, not passive
- [ ] Specific over vague (numbers, names, details)

### Auto-Reject Patterns:
- Sentences over 15 words (strict: over-performing posts use <12)
- More than 2 clauses per sentence
- Passive voice in >30% of sentences
- Complex vocabulary (e.g., "utilize" instead of "use")

---

## 4. Scannability Rules (Critical for Mobile)

### Formatting Requirements
- [ ] **Break most lines to new lines** (makes it scannable)
- [ ] **Some lines combined for flow** (when breaking feels forced)
- [ ] **Max 3-4 lines per paragraph** (no walls of text)
- [ ] **No walls of text** (auto-reject if 5+ lines without break)
- [ ] Simple words throughout
- [ ] Use bullets for lists (👉, →, 1., 2., 3.)

### Line Breaking Strategy

**Default:** Break thoughts to new lines
**Sometimes:** Combine related ideas for natural flow

**Good Balance (Most broken, some combined):**
```
I built a team task CLI. Not a simple todo app, but a task assignment system for agencies.

The requirement was to build a todo CLI.
Most people would add tasks, mark them done, delete them.

But I thought: what if agencies need to assign work to teams?

So I built:
 • Create and assign tasks
 • Filter by status or assignee
```

**Too Broken (Artificial):**
```
I built a team task CLI.
Not a simple todo app.
But for agencies.

The requirement was:
Build a todo CLI.
```

**Too Combined (Wall of text):**
```
I built a team task CLI called TaskFlow which is a task assignment system for agencies because the requirement was to build a todo CLI but most people would add tasks and mark them done.
```

### Auto-Reject If:
- Any paragraph has 4+ lines without break
- Lines exceed 80 characters consistently
- No white space between thoughts
