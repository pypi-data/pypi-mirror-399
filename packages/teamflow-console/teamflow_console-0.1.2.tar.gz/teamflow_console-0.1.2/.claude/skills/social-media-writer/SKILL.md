**What I Care About:**

- Small codebases
- Clear architecture
- Fewer moving parts
- Free/low-cost tooling that actually works
- Real constraints (hackathons, limits, deadlines)

**Personal Traits That Shape Writing:**

- Introverted - I do not naturally seek attention
- I share after doing the work, not before
- Avoids hype, exaggeration, "guru" tone
- More comfortable explaining how something worked than selling an idea

**Why I Write Publicly:**

- Share what I've learned the hard way
- Reduce friction for others building similar things
- Document decisions, not just outcomes

**Why I Do NOT Write:**

- Chase engagement
- Sound impressive
- Pretend certainty where it doesn't exist

**Perspective Rule (Critical):**
Every post should come from this angle:

> "I'm a builder sharing a real moment, decision, or lesson from active work — not teaching from a pedestal."

If a post does not feel like it could be said honestly to:

- A fellow student
- A teammate
- A respected mentor

Then it should not be published.

**Voice Summary (One Line):**
A quiet builder, learning in public, sharing practical lessons from real constraints — without hype, without polish, without pretending to have it all figured out.

## Core Writing Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness

- Say exactly what you mean
- One idea per sentence
- Short words, short sentences
- If you can remove a word without losing meaning, remove it
- Use simple English that even non-natives understand

### 2. Human-First Tone

- Write like you talk to a colleague over coffee
- Casual but professional
- No "synergy," "leverage," "game-changing"
- Admit when you don't know something
- Share struggles, not just wins

### 3. Earned Confidence

- State facts, don't hype
- Let results speak
- "This worked for me" not "This will change your life"
- Specifics over superlatives

## Tone Rules

| Rule                           | Example                                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Be calm, not excited           | "Here's what worked" not "This is INSANE!"          |
| Be direct, not dramatic        | "I learned X" not "My life was forever changed"     |
| Be grounded, not inspirational | "Try this approach" not "Follow your dreams"        |
| Be specific, not vague         | "Reduced latency by 40%" not "Massive improvements" |
| Be honest, not performative    | "I struggled with this" not "Crushing it!"          |
| Be simple, not complex         | "Use this tool" not "Leverage this synergy"         |

## Optimal Post Length (Based on Top Creator Research)

| Platform      | Optimal Range  | Max Limit  | "See More" Cutoff |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| **LinkedIn**  | 700-1000 chars | 3000 chars | ~140 chars        |
| **Twitter/X** | 200-270 chars  | 280 chars  | N/A               |
| **WhatsApp**  | 50-150 chars   | None       | N/A               |

**Research Findings:**

- Posts with 900-1200 characters get optimal reach (LinkedIn)
- Short sentences under 12 words perform 20% better
- Long conversational posts (2500+ chars) can perform 2x better, but 700-1000 is sweet spot
- First 1-3 lines determine if people click "See More"

## Sentence Style

- **Length**: 8-12 words max (under 12 words performs 20% better)
- **Structure**: Subject-verb-object, one clause per sentence
- **Voice**: Active, not passive
- **Jargon**: Only industry-specific terms your audience knows
- **Punctuation**: Periods > exclamation points (use sparingly)
- **Language**: Simple English, avoid complex vocabulary

## Scannability Rules (Critical for Mobile Readers)

### Formatting Requirements

- **One-liner hook**: First line must grab attention
- **Break most lines to new lines**: Makes it scannable on mobile
- **Some lines can be combined**: For natural flow, when breaking feels forced
- **Max 3-4 lines per paragraph**: No walls of text
- **Simple words**: Avoid complex vocabulary
- **Use bullets for lists**: 👉 → 1. 2. 3. for readability
- **Limit emojis**: Max 1-2 per post, use intentionally

### Line Breaking Strategy

**Default:** Break thoughts to new lines
**Sometimes:** Combine related ideas for flow

**Good balance (Most broken, some combined):**
```
I built a team task CLI. Not a simple todo app, but a task assignment system for agencies.

The requirement was to build a todo CLI.
Most people would add tasks, mark them done, delete them.

But I thought: what if agencies need to assign work to teams?

So I built:
 • Create and assign tasks
 • Filter by status or assignee
 • Update and reassign
 • Delete when done
```

**Too broken (Artificial):**
```
I built a team task CLI.
Not a simple todo app.
But for agencies.

The requirement was:
Build a todo CLI.

Most would do:
• Add tasks
• Mark done
```

**BAD! Too combined (Wall of text):**
```
I built a team task CLI called TaskFlow which is a task assignment system for agencies because the requirement was to build a todo CLI but most people would add tasks and mark them done so I thought what if agencies need to assign work to teams and I built something different.
```

### Quick Checklist

- [ ] Hook is one clear line
- [ ] Most thoughts broken to new lines (scannable)
- [ ] Some lines combined for natural rhythm
- [ ] No paragraph longer than 3-4 lines

## Viral Post Structures (From Top Creators)

### Structure 1: The 5-Step Formula (Justin Welsh)

```
1. THE HOOK (Lines 1-2)
   → Bold statement or tension-loaded truth
   → Skip backstory, hook immediately

2. THE SETUP (Lines 3-5)
   → Brief context
   → Why this matters

3. THE VALUE BOMB
   → The meat of your content
   → What you're teaching or sharing

4. THE TAKEAWAY
   → Key lesson or insight
   → What to remember

5. THE CTA
   → Question or prompt
   → Encourage comments/shares
```

### Structure 2: Problem → Process → Outcome → Lesson (Aisha Riaz)

```
PROBLEM: What you were trying to solve
↓
PROCESS: What you actually did
↓
OUTCOME: What happened (with numbers)
↓
LESSON: What you learned
```

### Structure 3: S.T.A.R. Framework (Storytelling)

```
SITUATION: What you were working on (1-2 sentences)
↓
TASK: What you needed to solve (1 sentence)
↓
ACTION: What you actually did (2-3 sentences)
↓
RESULT: What happened (1-2 sentences with metrics)
```

### Structure 4: Authentic Voice (User's Pattern)

```
HOOK: Vulnerable admission or observation
↓
BACKSTORY: "For a long time..." or "I held back..."
↓
TURNING POINT: "But then something happened..."
↓
ACTION: What you did
↓
RESULT: What happened
↓
REFLECTION: What you'd tell others
```

I just shipped my first CLI app.

It's called TaskFlow.

Here's what it does:
 • Add tasks
 • List tasks
 • Delete tasks

Built with Python and Typer.
Took 2 weeks of evenings.

Main takeaway:
Just build something.
The learning happens in the trenches.

What's your first project?
👇

#python #cli #webdev
```

## Examples

### Master Example (The Gold Standard)

This post shows perfect balance of scannability + natural flow:

```
Hackathon 2 — Phase 1 is done.

The task was simple on paper.
Build a todo CLI.

Add tasks.
Mark them done.
Delete them.
Move on.

I paused.

Because real teams don't work like solo todo lists.

Agencies assign work.
Track who's responsible.
Reassign when things change.

So instead of building another basic todo app, I built something closer to how teams actually work.

A small team task CLI.

What it does:
👉 Create tasks and assign them to team members
👉 Filter tasks by status or assignee
👉 Update details and reassign work
👉 Delete tasks when they're done

Built with Python + Typer.
In-memory storage for now.

It still meets the hackathon requirements.
But it solves a more realistic problem.

Phase 2 is where this gets interesting.
This can grow into a simple CRM or team management tool.
The base is already there.

One thing I keep learning in hackathons:
Standing out isn't about adding more features.
It's about thinking one step closer to the real world.

#Hackathon2 #Python #CLI #BuildingInPublic #DeveloperJourney
```

**Why this works:**
- Ultra-short lines create rhythm and emphasis
- "I paused." stands alone for dramatic effect
- Related thoughts combined where natural
- Mix of sentence lengths creates voice
- Easy to scan on mobile
- Sounds like a real person

**Key techniques to copy:**
1. **Very short lines** (2-3 words) for pacing: "Add tasks. Mark them done."
2. **Single-line emphasis**: "I paused."
3. **Combined flow**: "Because real teams don't work like solo todo lists."
4. **Build tension → release**: Problem buildup → solution → insight

I just shipped my first CLI app.

It's called TaskFlow.

Here's what it does:
 👉 Add tasks
 👉 List tasks
 👉 Delete tasks

Built with Python and Typer.
Took 2 weeks of evenings.

Hit plenty of bugs along the way.
But I learned a lot.

Main takeaway:
Just build something.
The learning happens in the trenches.

What's your first project?
👇

#python #cli #webdev

### Technical Post (LinkedIn) - 820 chars

```
Spent 4 hours debugging a race condition.

Here's what I learned.

The problem:
Async function wasn't awaiting a critical DB call.

Data races are silent killers.
By the time you see them, damage is done.

The fix:
1. Make it synchronous first
2. Add type hints
3. Make it async only where needed

Lesson:
When in doubt, keep it simple.
Add complexity only when proven.

Ever hit a race condition?
What happened?

👇

#python #async #debugging
```

### Advice Post (LinkedIn) - 680 chars

```
Stop wasting time on free API keys.

Here's a better way.

The problem:
Free keys expire constantly.
Breaks your flow.
Slows everything down.

The solution:
If you can afford $3, get a paid plan.

What you get:
 • Stable usage
 • No shutdowns
 • Focus on building

I use the $3 GLM plan.
Works great for coding.

Setup is simple:
1. Buy the plan
2. Copy API key
3. Add to settings.json
4. Done

Let's spend time building.
Not fixing keys.

What's your setup?
