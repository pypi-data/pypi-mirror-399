Hackathon 2 - Phase 1 is done.

The task was simple on paper.
Build a todo CLI.

Add tasks.
Mark them done.
Delete them.
Move on.

I paused.

Because real teams don't work like solo todo lists.

Agencies assign work.
Track who's responsible.
Reassign when things change.

So instead of building another basic todo app, I built something closer to how teams actually work.

A small team task CLI.

What it does:
👉 Create tasks and assign them to team members
👉 Filter tasks by status or assignee
👉 Update details and reassign work
👉 Delete tasks when they're done

Built with Python + Typer.
In-memory storage for now.

It still meets the hackathon requirements.
But it solves a more realistic problem.

Phase 2 is where this gets interesting.
This can grow into a simple CRM or team management tool.
The base is already there.

One thing I keep learning in hackathons:
Standing out isn't about adding more features.
It's about thinking one step closer to the real world.
