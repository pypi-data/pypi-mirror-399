# python-sn2

Python library for SystemNexa2 device integration.

This package provides a client library for communicating with SystemNexa2 smart home
devices over WebSocket and REST APIs. It supports device discovery, real-time state
updates, brightness control, and configuration management.

Supported Devices
-----------------
- Switches: WBR-01
- Plugs: WPR-01, WPO-01
- Lights: WBD-01, WPD-01

Key Features
------------
- Asynchronous communication via WebSocket and REST
- Real-time device state updates
- Brightness control for dimmable devices
- Device settings management (433MHz, LED, DIY mode, etc.)
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Error handling and logging

## Installation

```bash
pip install python-sn2
```

## Usage

```python
"""Example usage of the python-sn2 library."""

import asyncio
import logging

from sn2.device import Device

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


async def main() -> None:
    """Demonstrate device usage."""
    # Create a device instance
    device = await Device.initiate_device(host="192.168.1.144")

    # Connect to the device
    await device.connect()

    # Set brightness
    await device.set_brightness(0.75)

    # Get device information
    info = await device.get_info()
    logger.info("Device: %s", info.information.name)

    # Disconnect
    await device.disconnect()

    await device.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Development

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.

Setup the development environment:

```bash
./scripts/test-setup
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Create virtual environment and install package
uv venv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run linting:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

## Release Process

This project uses automated versioning and releases. To create a new release:

### Automated (Recommended)

```bash
# Bump patch version (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)
./scripts/release.sh patch

# Bump minor version (0.1.0 -> 0.2.0)
./scripts/release.sh minor

# Bump major version (0.1.0 -> 1.0.0)
./scripts/release.sh major
```

This will:
1. Run tests and linting
2. Bump version in `pyproject.toml` and `sn2/__init__.py`
3. Create a git commit and tag
4. Push to GitHub
5. Trigger GitHub Actions to build and publish to PyPI

### Manual

```bash
# Install bump-my-version
uv pip install bump-my-version

# Bump version
bump-my-version bump patch  # or minor/major

# Push changes and tags
git push origin main --tags
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Create a GitHub release with release notes
- Build the package
- Publish to PyPI (via Trusted Publishing)
