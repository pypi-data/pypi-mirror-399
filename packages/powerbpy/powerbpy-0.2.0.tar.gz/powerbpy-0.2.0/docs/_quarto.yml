      desc: The first thing you should create is an instance of the Dashboard class. Then use the `add_page()` or `load_page()` functions to attach instances of the internal `_Page` class to the dashboard. All methods are attached to either dashboards or pages. Refer to the two links below to see which methods are attached to which class. For more details about how to build dashboards, see the test dashboard [tutorial](https://www.russellshean.com/powerbpy/example_dashboards/Test%20Dashboard/Testing%20Dashboard.html) section of this website.
