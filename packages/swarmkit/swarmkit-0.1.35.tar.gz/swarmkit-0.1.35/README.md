# SwarmKit Python SDK

SwarmKit lets you run and orchestrate terminal-based AI agents in secure sandboxes with built-in observability.

## Get Started

1. Get your **SwarmKit API key** at [dashboard.swarmlink.ai](https://dashboard.swarmlink.ai/) (new users: [request access](https://dashboard.swarmlink.ai/request-access) first)

2. Get an **E2B API key** at [e2b.dev](https://e2b.dev) for sandbox execution

3. Install the SDK:
   ```bash
   pip install swarmkit
   ```
   **Note:** Requires [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) (the SDK uses a lightweight Node.js bridge).

4. Check out the [official documentation](https://github.com/brandomagnani/swarmkit/tree/main/docs) and [cookbooks](https://github.com/brandomagnani/swarmkit/tree/main/cookbooks) to start shipping with SwarmKit!

## Streaming Events

You can subscribe to streaming events:

- `stdout`: Raw NDJSON output from the agent/CLI (may arrive in chunks).
- `stderr`: Process stderr (may arrive in chunks).
- `content`: Parsed ACP-style events (messages, tool calls, plan updates).

### Large Outputs

The Node bridge enforces per-event size limits for responsiveness.

- `stdout`/`stderr` are chunked when very large; your callback receives each chunk normally.
- `content` events are lossless: if a payload is too large to stream safely, you receive a truncated preview plus a `ref` to a local JSON file containing the full payload.

Example:

```py
def on_content(evt):
    if evt.get("truncated") and evt.get("ref"):
        full_update = open(evt["ref"]["path"], "r", encoding="utf-8").read()
        # full_update is the original ACP update JSON

swarmkit.on("content", on_content)
```
