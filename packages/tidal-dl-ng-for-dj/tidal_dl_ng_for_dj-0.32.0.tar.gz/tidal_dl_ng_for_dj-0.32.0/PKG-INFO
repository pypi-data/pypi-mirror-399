## 💻 Installation / Upgrade

**Requirements**: Python version 3.12 / 3.13 (other versions might work but are not tested!)

```bash
pip install --upgrade tidal-dl-ng
# If you like to have the GUI as well use this command instead
pip install --upgrade "tidal-dl-ng[gui]"
```

## ⌨️ Usage

You can use the command line (CLI) version to download media by URL:

```bash
tidal-dl-ng dl https://tidal.com/browse/track/46755209
# OR
tdn dl https://tidal.com/browse/track/46755209
```

Or by your favorites collections:

```bash
tidal-dl-ng dl_fav tracks
tidal-dl-ng dl_fav artists
tidal-dl-ng dl_fav albums
tidal-dl-ng dl_fav videos
```

You can also use the GUI:

```bash
tidal-dl-ng-gui
# OR
tdng
# OR
tidal-dl-ng gui
```

If you would like to use the GUI version as a binary, have a look at the
[release page](https://github.com/FunWarry/tidal-dl-ng-For-DJ/releases) and download the correct version for your OS.

## ▶️ Getting started with development

### 🚰 Install dependencies

Clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
# First, install Poetry. On some operating systems you need to use `pip` instead of `pipx`
pipx install --upgrade poetry
poetry install --all-extras --with dev,docs
```

The main entry points are:

```bash
tidal_ng_dl/cli.py
tidal_ng_dl/gui.py
```

### 📺 GUI Builder

The GUI is built with `PySide6` using the [Qt Designer](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtdesigner-manual.html):

```bash
PYSIDE_DESIGNER_PLUGINS=tidal_dl_ng/ui pyside6-designer
```

After all changes are saved, you need to translate the Qt Designer `*.ui` file into Python code, for instance:

```
pyside6-uic tidal_dl_ng/ui/main.ui -o tidal_dl_ng/ui/main.py
```

This needs to be done for each created / modified `*.ui` file accordingly.

### 🏗 Build the project

To build the project use this command:

```bash
# Install virtual environment and dependencies if not already done
make install
# Build macOS GUI
make gui-macos-dmg
# OR Build Windows GUI
make gui-windows
# OR Build Linux GUI
make gui-linux
# Check build output
ls dist/
```

See the `Makefile` for all available build commands.

The CI/CD pipeline will be triggered when you open a pull request, merge to main, or when you create a new release.

## ❓ FAQ

### macOS Error Message: File/App is damaged and cannot be opened. You should move it to Trash

If you download an (unsigned) app from any source other than those that Apple seems suited, the application gets an
extended attribute "com.apple.Quarantine". This triggers the message: "<application> is damaged and can't be opened. You
should move it to the Bin."

Remove the attribute and you can launch the
application. [Source 1](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253714860?sortBy=rank) [Source 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/13vu7f3/app_is_damaged_and_cant_be_opened_error_on_ventura/)

```
sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/TIDAL-Downloader-NG.app/
```

Why is this app unsigned? Only developer enrolled in the paid Apple developer program are allowed to sign (legal) apps.
Without this subscription app signing is not possible.

Gatekeeper really annoys you, and you like to disable it completely? Follow
this [link](https://iboysoft.com/tips/how-to-disable-gatekeeper-macos-sequoia.html)

### My (Windows) antivirus app XYZ says the GUI version of this app is harmful

Short answer: It is a lie. Get rid of your antivirus app.

Long answer: See [here](https://github.com/FunWarry/tidal-dl-ng-For-DJ/issues/231)

### I get an error when `extract_flac` is enabled

Your `path_binary_ffmpeg` is probably wrong. Please read over and over again the help of this particular option until
you get it right what path to put for `path_binary_ffmpeg`.

### My Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) complains that `libxcb-cursor0` is not installed

Simply install this dependency using your OS specific package manager.

Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0
```

### A terminal is flashing when I run this app on Windows

Please see this issue [#103](https://github.com/FunWarry/tidal-dl-ng-For-DJ/issues/103).

This is due to the Python `ffmpeg` library which is used and only happens on windows if `extract_flac` is activated.

### How can I download Dolby Atmos files?

You need to activate `download_dolby_atmos` in the settings. Then, if an item is available in Dolby Atmos, it will be
downloaded as an Dolby Atmos file instead of as an stereo audio file. Dolby Atmos ist only available as 320kbps at
TIDAL (you cannot adjust the quality for Dolby Atmos downloads). If an item is available in Dolby Atmos the "Quality"
column in the GUI will indicate this with `Dolby Atmos`

### Why do some metadata fields show "—" or "N/A"?

Some metadata fields like Genres, Producers, Composers, Label, or BPM may display `—` because **the TIDAL API does not
provide this information** for that specific track or album. This is not a bug - TIDAL simply doesn't have or doesn't
expose this data via their API.

- **Bitrate shows "N/A"** for LOSSLESS tracks because they use variable bitrate compression
- **Extended metadata** (genres, producers, etc.) depends on what TIDAL receives from music labels
- See the [detailed metadata documentation](docs/missing_metadata.md) for more information
