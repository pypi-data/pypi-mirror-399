## 🎯 Documentation Standards

All documentation in this project follows our universal standards:

### Why → What → How Structure
1. **Why**: Purpose, motivation, and context
2. **What**: What the component/feature/system does
3. **How**: Implementation details, code examples, and technical specifics

### Visual First Approach
- Mermaid diagrams for complex logic and workflows
- Visual aids before bullet lists
- Make abstract concepts concrete through visualization

### Progressive Information Architecture
- Orientation before implementation
- Context before code
- Understanding before examples

## 🏗️ Architecture Quick Reference

```mermaid

    A[OpenAPI Spec] --> B[Loading Stage]
    B --> C[Intermediate Representation]
    C --> D[Unified Type Resolution]
    D --> E[Visiting Stage]
    E --> F[Code Generation]
    F --> G[Emitting Stage]
    G --> H[Generated Client]
```

PyOpenAPI Generator transforms OpenAPI specifications into production-ready Python clients through a three-stage pipeline designed for enterprise-grade reliability and type safety.

## 🤝 Contributing to Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. **Follow the Standards**: Use Why→What→How structure with mermaid diagrams
2. **Keep it Current**: Update docs when changing code
3. **Test Examples**: Ensure all code examples work
4. **Link Appropriately**: Cross-reference related documentation

See our [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines on documentation standards and the development workflow.
