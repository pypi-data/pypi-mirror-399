            Review this PR for code quality, security, and compatibility:

            **IMPORTANT: DO NOT run quality gates (formatting, linting, tests, type checking)**
            The CI pipeline already handles: Black, Ruff, mypy, Bandit, and pytest.
            Focus on code logic, architecture, and security only.

            **For Dependabot PRs with Poetry lock conflicts:**
            1. Check if conflicts are only in `pyproject.toml` and/or `poetry.lock`
            2. If yes, follow the Poetry Lock Conflict Resolution protocol in CLAUDE.md
            3. Resolve conflicts, regenerate lock file, run quality checks and tests
            4. Commit and push the resolution
            5. Comment on PR with resolution details

            **For hotfixes and minor fixes:**
            1. If code logic is sound and architecture is good, fix any issues directly
            2. Provide detailed analysis in comments
            3. Note if manual approval is recommended

            **For larger changes:**
            1. Provide comprehensive review feedback on logic and architecture
            2. Create issues for complex problems
            3. Suggest improvements and alternatives

            **Focus on:**
            - Code logic and correctness
            - Security vulnerabilities and best practices
            - Architecture decisions and design patterns
            - API compatibility and breaking changes
            - Algorithm efficiency and performance implications
            - Poetry lock conflict resolution (for dependabot PRs)

            **Skip (CI handles these):**
            - Formatting checks (Black)
            - Linting (Ruff)
            - Type checking (mypy)
            - Security scanning (Bandit)
            - Test execution (pytest)
