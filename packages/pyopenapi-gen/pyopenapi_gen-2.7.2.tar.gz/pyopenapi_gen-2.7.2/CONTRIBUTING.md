## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Poetry (recommended) or pip
- Git

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pyopenapi-gen.git
cd pyopenapi-gen

# Add the upstream repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/pyopenapi-gen.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment (REQUIRED)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies with Poetry (recommended)
poetry install --with dev

# OR install with pip
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
# Run quality checks to ensure everything works
make quality-fix  # Auto-fix formatting and linting
make quality      # Run all quality checks  
make test         # Run tests with coverage

# If everything passes, you're ready to contribute!
```

## 🛠️ Development Environment

### Essential Commands

**Always activate the virtual environment first:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Quality Workflow (run before every commit):**
```bash
# Auto-fix what's possible
make quality-fix

# Run all quality checks (must pass for PR approval)
make quality

# Individual commands
make format         # Auto-format with Black
make format-check   # Check formatting without fixing
make lint           # Check linting with Ruff
make lint-fix       # Auto-fix linting issues
make typecheck      # Type checking with mypy
make security       # Security scanning with Bandit
```

**Testing Workflow:**
```bash
# Standard testing (required for PRs)
make test           # Run all tests with 85% coverage requirement

# Development testing options  
make test-fast      # Run tests, stop on first failure
make test-serial    # Run tests sequentially (if parallel tests hang)
make test-no-cov    # Run tests without coverage (fastest)

# Specific test targeting
pytest tests/core/test_loader.py                    # Single test file
pytest tests/core/test_pagination.py::test_method   # Single test method
pytest -k "test_cycle_detection"                    # Tests by pattern
```

## 🎨 Code Standards

### Code Quality Requirements

All contributions must pass our quality gates:

- ✅ **Formatting**: Black (120 character line length)
- ✅ **Linting**: Ruff for code quality and import sorting
- ✅ **Type Safety**: mypy strict mode with 100% type coverage
- ✅ **Security**: Bandit security scanning
- ✅ **Testing**: ≥85% branch coverage with pytest

### Style Guidelines

**Python Version Compatibility:**
- Python 3.12+ required
- Use modern Python features where appropriate
- Avoid deprecated features

**Code Organization:**
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Use dataclasses for data structures
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions focused and testable

**Naming Conventions:**
- Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `SchemaParser`)
- Functions/variables: `snake_case` (e.g., `parse_schema`)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_DEPTH`)
- Private members: prefix with `_` (e.g., `_internal_method`)

**Import Organization:**
```python
# Standard library imports
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

# Third-party imports
import httpx
from jinja2 import Template

# Local imports
from .core.schemas import IRSchema
from .helpers.type_helper import resolve_type
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Testing Philosophy

We follow strict testing standards to ensure reliability:

- **Framework**: pytest only (no unittest.TestCase)
- **Coverage**: ≥85% branch coverage required
- **Isolation**: Mock all external dependencies
- **Clarity**: Tests should be self-documenting

### Test Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that follow this pattern:
```
test_<unit_of_work>__<condition>__<expected_outcome>()
```

Examples:
```python
def test_parse_schema__with_circular_reference__returns_forward_reference():
def test_generate_client__missing_operations__raises_generation_error():
def test_resolve_type__unknown_schema__returns_any_type():
```

### Test Structure

Follow the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern:

```python
def test_schema_parser__with_circular_reference__handles_gracefully():
    """
    Scenario: Parser encounters a schema with circular references.
    Expected Outcome: Parser should detect the cycle and use forward references.
    """
    # Arrange
    spec_data = {
        "User": {
            "type": "object", 
            "properties": {
                "friend": {"$ref": "#/components/schemas/User"}
            }
        }
    }
    parser = SchemaParser()
    
    # Act
    result = parser.parse_schema("User", spec_data["User"], spec_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result.type_hint == "User"
    assert result.forward_ref is True
```

### Test Documentation

Include clear docstrings with scenario and expected outcome:

```python
def test_complex_scenario():
    """
    Scenario: Detailed description of what's being tested.
    Expected Outcome: What should happen in this scenario.
    """
```

### Testing Best Practices

**Mock External Dependencies:**
```python
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

@patch('httpx.AsyncClient')
def test_http_request__with_auth__includes_headers(mock_client):
    # Test implementation
    pass
```

**Use Parametrization for Multiple Cases:**
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_type,expected", [
    ("string", "str"),
    ("integer", "int"),
    ("boolean", "bool"),
])
def test_type_resolution__primitive_types__returns_correct_python_type(input_type, expected):
    # Test implementation
    pass
```

**Test Error Conditions:**
```python
def test_loader__invalid_spec__raises_validation_error():
    with pytest.raises(ValidationError) as exc_info:
        load_spec("invalid-spec.yaml")
    
    assert "Invalid OpenAPI specification" in str(exc_info.value)
```

## 📚 Documentation Standards

### Universal Documentation Conventions

All documentation in this project follows these standards:

#### 1. Mermaid Diagrams for Logic Visualization
- Always use mermaid diagrams to visualize complex logic, workflows, and system relationships
- Include diagrams before diving into implementation details
- Make abstract concepts concrete through visual representation

#### 2. Chapter Structure: Why → What → How
- **Why**: Start with the purpose, motivation, and context
- **What**: Explain what the component/feature/system does  
- **How**: Then provide implementation details, code examples, and technical specifics

#### 3. Progressive Information Architecture
- Orientation before implementation
- Context before code
- Understanding before examples
- Visual aids before bullet lists

### Documentation Types

**Code Documentation:**
- Use clear, descriptive docstrings for all public APIs
- Include type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Add examples for complex functions

**Architecture Documentation:**
- Follow the Why→What→How structure
- Include mermaid diagrams for system relationships
- Explain design decisions and trade-offs

**API Documentation:**
- Document all public interfaces
- Include usage examples
- Document error conditions and exceptions

### Example Documentation Structure

```python
class SchemaParser:
    """Parses OpenAPI schemas into typed IR models.
    
    Why: OpenAPI schemas contain complex nested structures and circular 
    references that need careful parsing to generate correct Python types.
    
    What: Transforms raw OpenAPI schema dictionaries into strongly-typed
    IRSchema objects with proper cycle detection and reference resolution.
    
    How: Uses a multi-pass approach with state tracking to handle complex
    schema relationships while building a clean intermediate representation.
    
    Example:
        >>> parser = SchemaParser()
        >>> schema = parser.parse_schema("User", schema_dict, all_schemas)
        >>> print(schema.type_hint)  # "User"
    """
    
    def parse_schema(self, name: str, schema_dict: Dict[str, Any], 
                    all_schemas: Dict[str, Any]) -> IRSchema:
        """Parse a single schema definition.
        
        Args:
            name: Schema name from OpenAPI spec
            schema_dict: Raw schema definition
            all_schemas: All available schemas for reference resolution
            
        Returns:
            Parsed schema with resolved types and cycle detection
            
        Raises:
            ParseError: When schema is malformed or contains unsupported features
        """
```

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

### Understanding the Codebase

PyOpenAPI Generator follows a three-stage pipeline:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[OpenAPI Spec] --> B[Loading Stage]
    B --> C[Intermediate Representation]
    C --> D[Unified Type Resolution]
    D --> E[Visiting Stage] 
    E --> F[Python Code Generation]
    F --> G[Emitting Stage]
    G --> H[Generated Client Files]
```

**Stage 1: Loading (`core/loader/` & `core/parsing/`)**
- Parse OpenAPI specifications
- Detect and resolve circular references
- Build intermediate representation (IR)

**Stage 2: Visiting (`visit/`)**
- Transform IR into Python code
- Generate models, endpoints, and client classes
- Apply unified type resolution

**Stage 3: Emitting (`emitters/`)**
- Organize code into proper package structure
- Write files with correct imports
- Apply post-processing (formatting, type checking)

### Key Design Principles

**Separation of Concerns:**
- Each stage has clear responsibilities
- Clean interfaces between components
- Testable, focused modules

**Type Safety:**
- Strict mypy checking throughout
- Comprehensive type hints
- Runtime type validation where needed

**Extensibility:**
- Plugin-based authentication
- Configurable type resolution
- Modular emitters for different output formats

### Contributing to Architecture

When making architectural changes:

1. **Understand the Impact:**
   - Consider effects on all three stages
   - Ensure backward compatibility
   - Document design decisions

2. **Follow Existing Patterns:**
   - Use dataclasses for data structures
   - Implement protocols for interfaces
   - Keep classes focused and testable

3. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Test the happy path
   - Test error conditions
   - Test edge cases and complex scenarios
