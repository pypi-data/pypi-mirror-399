# High-Quality Code Specification – Simplicity, Readability, and Maintainability First

## Core Principles (Highest Priority)
- Always choose the simplest, most readable, and maintainable solution, even if it looks "less fancy."
- Use design patterns reasonably, but strictly forbid premature abstraction, premature optimization, and over-engineering.
- If a piece of code takes a reader (including future you) more than 10 seconds to understand, it is bad code.
- If 10 lines of straightforward code can solve the problem, never use 50 lines of "elegant" design patterns.

## Python Code Quality Requirements

### Readability & Conciseness
- Variable, function, and class names must precisely describe their purpose. Use full words (abbreviations forbidden except widely accepted ones like `id`, `df`, etc.).
- Functions should generally not exceed 50 lines; if longer, seriously consider splitting them.
- Forbid clever but obscure tricks (e.g., excessive list/dict comprehensions, abuse of `*args`/`**kwargs`, or overuse of decorators).
- Complex logic must be broken into small functions; each function does exactly one thing, and its name must be a verb or verb phrase.

### Type System (Mandatory)
- 100% type annotations (Type Hints) are required for all new code.
- Using `Any` is forbidden unless dealing with dynamic JSON or forced by third-party libraries.
- Prefer modern Python type features: `dataclass`, `TypedDict`, `Protocol`, `NewType`, etc.

### Design & Architecture
- Favor functional style + data classes over deep class inheritance hierarchies.
- Composition over inheritance; only introduce abstract base classes or `Protocol` when multiple implementations actually exist.
- Circular imports are strictly prohibited.
- Configuration, logging, database connections, and other resources must be injected via dependency injection; never create them at module level.

### Error Handling & Resource Management
- Expected exceptions must be handled explicitly; bare `except:` is forbidden.
- File, network, database, and similar resources must be used inside context managers (`with` statement).
- All public interfaces (APIs, CLI, webhooks, etc.) must validate inputs and return proper errors.

### Logging & Debugging
- Critical paths must emit `info`-level logs; exceptions must be logged at `error` level with full context.
- Using `print()` for debugging is forbidden (except in temporary throw-away scripts).

### Testing Requirements
- All core business logic must have unit tests located in the `tests/` directory.
- Test function naming: `test_<feature>_<expected_behavior>`, e.g., `test_calculate_tax_when_income_above_threshold`.
- Use `pytest` + `pytest-cov`; core modules must achieve ≥90% coverage.
- Never introduce new features or bug fixes without accompanying tests.

### Performance & Security
- O(n²) or worse algorithms in hot paths are forbidden unless explicitly justified.
- Any code handling user input must consider injection, overflow, XSS, and other security risks.
- Hard-coding secrets, passwords, or API keys is strictly prohibited; they must come from configuration or secret management systems.

### Code Formatting (MUST Follow)
- Line length: 100 characters maximum.
- Use `ruff` for linting with `line-length = 100`, `target-version = "py310"`.
- Import order: standard library → third-party → local; sort alphabetically within each group.
- Use double quotes for strings.
- Add trailing commas in multi-line collections.
- Strictly adhere to `ruff` configuration; zero lint errors allowed.
- Type annotations are required for all new code (pyright validation is a goal, not yet enforced in CI).

### Strict Rules for Code Generation
- Never create `.md`, `README`, or any documentation files unless explicitly requested.
- Never create `examples/`, `sample/`, `demo.py`, or similar example files unless explicitly requested.
- Do not add unnecessary `.pyi` stubs or pollute `__init__.py` with excessive exports.
- All comments, docstrings, log messages, and error messages must be in English.
- When modifying the logic of an existing method, always examine the full surrounding context and thoroughly understand the original intent and behavior before making any changes.
