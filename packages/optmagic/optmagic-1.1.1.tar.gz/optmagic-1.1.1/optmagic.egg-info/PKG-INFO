# `optmagic` version 1.1.1

This project enables you to create simple command line interfaces starting
with a python class, or a python function that you want to expose directly to the shell.

It contains functionality which has not yet all been fully documented. Stay tuned.

### Why not use one of those?

Ideally, the programmer should not have to specify anything extra than what the class or function already contains to expose its functionality. None of these other packages strive to accomplish that goal like `optmagic` does, as you can see in the following comparative examples.
