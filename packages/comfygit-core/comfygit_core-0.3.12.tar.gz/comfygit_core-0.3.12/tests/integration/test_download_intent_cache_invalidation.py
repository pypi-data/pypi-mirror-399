"""Integration tests for download intent cache invalidation bug.

Tests that workflow resolution cache properly invalidates when download intents
are added to pyproject.toml, ensuring subsequent status/resolve commands detect
the queued downloads instead of re-prompting the user.

Bug reproduction:
1. User runs `cfd status` → cache stores resolution with model in models_unresolved
2. User runs `cfd workflow resolve` → queues download (sources+path added to pyproject)
3. User runs `cfd status` again → cache NOT invalidated → still shows "models not found"
4. User runs `cfd workflow resolve` again → re-prompts for same model!

Expected behavior:
- Step 3 should show "N models not found, 1 queued for download"
- Step 4 should skip the download intent model and NOT re-prompt
