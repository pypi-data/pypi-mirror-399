"""Test that status correctly reports uninstalled nodes after resolution.

Bug: After workflow resolution adds nodes to the workflow's node list in pyproject.toml,
but before those nodes are actually installed, `status` should report them as needing
installation. Currently it incorrectly shows no issues because it compares
resolution.nodes_resolved (from re-parsing) against installed nodes, and both lists
now contain the nodes (even though they're not installed on disk).

Fix: Compare workflow's declared node list (from pyproject.toml) against actually
installed nodes (from pyproject.toml nodes section).
