"""Test that status provides proper abstraction - no pyproject.load() in display layer.

This test validates that WorkflowAnalysisStatus contains all information needed
for display without requiring the CLI to access raw pyproject.toml data.

Abstraction Violation:
- CLI should NOT call env.pyproject.load() to compute display values
- CLI should NOT parse TOML structure with .get('tool', {}).get('comfygit', {})
- CLI should receive complete, ready-to-display data from core

Correct Abstraction:
- uninstalled_nodes: packages that resolved but aren't installed
- nodes_unresolved: nodes that couldn't be resolved to any package
- CLI only iterates and prints - NO business logic
