"""Integration test for workflow resolution cleanup bug.

Bug Report:
When a user:
1. Commits workflow 'default'
2. Runs ComfyUI which saves 'depthflow_v2' (new workflow appears)
3. Resolves 'depthflow_v2'
4. Runs ComfyUI again which saves 'depthflow_v2_1' and deletes 'default'
5. Resolves 'depthflow_v2_1'

Expected: After step 5, pyproject.toml should only have 'depthflow_v2' and 'depthflow_v2_1'
Actual bug: pyproject.toml has 'default', 'depthflow_v2', and 'depthflow_v2_1'

Root cause: Workflow resolution (apply_resolution) doesn't clean up deleted workflows.
The cleanup only happens during commit, but users may resolve multiple times before committing.
