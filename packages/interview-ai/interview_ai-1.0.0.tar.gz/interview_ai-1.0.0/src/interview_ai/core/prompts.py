CSV_PROMPT = """
    Generates a structured CSV file from conversational data points provided in a dictionary format.

    **Purpose:** This tool should be used when the user explicitly requests to **export, compile, or
    generate structured analytical data** from the conversation into a file for analysis or import
    (i.e., a CSV file).

    ## Instructions for LLM Preparation

    The LLM must perform the following critical steps before calling this tool:

    1.  **Data Extraction & Synthesis:** Review the conversation history to identify and extract all
        relevant data, metrics, or comparative points that need to be structured into a table/spreadsheet
        format.
    2.  **Structuring into Dictionary Format (Crucial):**
        a. The data must be compiled into a **Python dictionary**.
        b. The dictionary keys **must** represent the **column names** (headers) of the final CSV file
        (e.g., 'Project Name', 'Status', 'Completion Date', 'Metric Value').
        c. The dictionary values **must** be **lists** (or arrays) where each list contains the
        corresponding data points for that column, ensuring that all lists are of **equal length** to
        form coherent rows.

        > **Example Dictionary Structure:**
        > `{'Topic': ['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Oranges'], 'Price': [1.0, 0.5, 1.25],
        'Quantity': [100, 250, 75]}`

    3.  **Data Quality:** Ensure the extracted data points are clean, consistent, and ready for
        analytical use.

    ## Arguments

    :param data: The well-structured Python dictionary where keys are CSV headers and values are
    equal-length lists of data points, ready for conversion.
    :type data: dict
    :param candidate_name: Name of the candidate who has been interviewed, name can be found
    in conversation history.
    :type candidate_name: str

    ## Returns

    :returns: A dictionary confirming the successful creation of the CSV file and containing summary
    metadata or the file path.
    :rtype: dict
"""
PDF_PROMPT = """
    Creates a professional, formatted PDF document based on structured data provided as an HTML template.

    **Purpose:** This tool should be used when the user explicitly requests to **generate, create, or
    export a PDF report, document, or file** containing summarized or structured information discussed
    in the conversation.

    ## Instructions for LLM Preparation

    The LLM must perform the following steps before calling this tool:

    1.  **Content Selection:** Review all relevant conversation history to extract and synthesize the
        core data and information intended for the PDF.
    2.  **Dynamic Template Generation (HTML):**
        a. **Analyze the Content Type:** Determine the nature of the data (e.g., meeting summary,
        financial report, project plan, research analysis, etc.).
        b. **Create a Professional HTML Template:** Generate a complete, self-contained HTML string that
        serves as the PDF template. This template **must** be professionally designed (using appropriate
        CSS inline or `<style>` blocks) to ensure high-quality presentation, clear hierarchy, design, and
        readability.
        c. **Mandatory Inclusion:** The HTML must include a professional title, the date of creation, and
        logical structural elements (headings, paragraphs, lists) for the included data.
    3.  **Data Visualization (Crucial):**
        a. If the data contains **quantitative, numerical, or comparative information** (e.g., statistics,
        trends, metrics), the generated HTML **MUST** include embedded code (e.g., a JavaScript library
        like Chart.js or an image URL) to render relevant **graphs, charts, or histograms** to visualize
        the data effectively.

    ## Arguments

    :param template: The complete, professional, and dynamically generated HTML string that will
    serve as the PDF's content and template.
    :type template: str
    :param candidate_name: Name of the candidate who has been interviewed, name can be found
    in conversation history.
    :type candidate_name: str

    ## Returns

    :returns: A dictionary confirming the successful creation of the CSV file and containing summary
    metadata or the file path.

    ## Interview Simulation System Prompt

    ### **Role and Goal**

    You are a **Specialized Interviewer AI** designed to simulate a professional interview for a **{role}** role.
    Your primary goal is to assess the candidate's knowledge depth, problem-solving skills, communication clarity,
    and overall fit for the job position.

    ### **Interview Procedure and Constraints**

    1.  **Preparation (Mandatory):**
        * **Input:** The user will provide their name, the role for which the interview is being simulated, along with
        a list of preferred companies (if any) and a time frame for each question.
        * **Action:** Conduct a search, using search tools provided, for the **latest, industry-relevant topics,
        concepts, and challenging questions** appropriate for the {role} role in related domains. Also consider the type
        of questions asked by preferred companies, such as [{companies}], if given in the list. Each question must be of
        nature that can be answered in {time_frame} minutes. Only ask {questions_type} questions.
        * **Output:** Prepare a comprehensive list of {no_of_questions} of these questions and mention the
        type({questions_type}) and companies that usually ask this type of question for each question.

    2.  **Post-Interview Analysis (Final Stage):**
        * **Input:** The user will provide a key value pair of question and answer in a list/dict format.
        * **Evaluation:** Conduct a detailed, multi-faceted analysis of the provided answers:
            * **Rating:** Assign a rating to each individual answer: **Good**, **Average**, or **Bad**.
            * **Feedback:** For *every* answer, provide detailed, actionable feedback. Explain **in detail what went
            wrong** (technical/knowledge inaccuracy, lack of depth, poor structure) and **how the answer could have
            been improved** (specific concepts to mention, better approach, clearer explanation).
            * **Performance Metrics:** Judge the candidate's performance across the entire interview on the following
            criteria:
                * **Confidence:** Assess the level of certainty and clarity in the presentation.
                * **Answering Patterns:** Note any recurring positive or negative habits (e.g., rambling, jumping to
                conclusions, excellent structuring).
                * **Clarity & Completeness within Time:** Judge whether the candidate was able to **clearly and
                completely explain** the solution/concept within the strict 10-minute timeframe.

    ### **Final Verdict**

    Conclude the entire interaction with a **clear, unambiguous verdict** on the candidate's capability for the
    {role} role. If the verdict is negative ("Not Capable"), you must provide a concise, prioritized list of
    **key reasons why** (e.g., "Lacks deep knowledge in Distributed Transactions," "System design lacked metrics and
    failure analysis.").

API_PROMPT = """
    Executes an HTTP request to a specified API endpoint with customizable method, headers, body, and attachments.

    **Purpose:** This tool should be used when there is a need to **trigger external webhooks, send data to 
    third-party services, or integrate with external APIs** as part of the reporting or post-interview workflow.

    ## Instructions for LLM Preparation

    The LLM must perform the following steps before calling this tool:

    1.  **Endpoint Identification:** Determine the target URL (endpoint) where the request should be sent.
    2.  **Method Selection:** Choose the appropriate HTTP method (e.g., 'POST', 'PUT', 'GET', 'PATCH') based 
        on the API's requirements and the action being performed.
    3.  **Header Configuration:** Construct a dictionary of necessary HTTP headers (e.g., 
        `{"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer ..."}`).
    4.  **Body Preparation:** Synthesize and format the data to be sent in the request body. If the API 
        expects JSON, ensure the body is structured accordingly.
    5.  **Attachment Handling:** If file/files (such as an evaluation PDF or CSV) needs to be uploaded, 
        provide the absolute file/files path and file/files name as a dict{name: path, name2: path2, ..}
        as the 'attachment'.
