## 🚀 Project Kickoff Prompt

```
I'm starting a new project using this project template. Please help me get started:

1. **Read PROJECT_IDEA.md first** - This contains my project vision, requirements, and current planning status

2. **Read AI_CONTEXT.md** - This provides technical context, coding standards, and development practices

3. **Review the current project state** - Check what files exist, what's implemented, what needs to be done

4. **Help me create an implementation plan** based on:
   - The requirements in PROJECT_IDEA.md
   - The architecture outlined there
   - The technical standards in AI_CONTEXT.md

5. **Generate starter code** for the first milestone/phase, following:
   - Project structure conventions
   - Code style from AI_CONTEXT.md
   - Architecture from PROJECT_IDEA.md

Please start by reading PROJECT_IDEA.md and summarizing:
- What problem we're solving
- Core features planned
- Current development phase
- Next immediate steps
```

## 🎯 Quick Reference

### Essential Files for AI
1. **PROJECT_IDEA.md** - Project vision, requirements, architecture
2. **AI_CONTEXT.md** - Technical standards, workflows, guidelines
3. **README.md** - Current project state
4. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - How to contribute

### Always Mention These Files
- When starting: "Please read PROJECT_IDEA.md and AI_CONTEXT.md first"
- When coding: "Follow standards in AI_CONTEXT.md"
- When planning: "Reference architecture in PROJECT_IDEA.md"
