```

## Quick Start

```python

from endee.endee import Endee

# Initialize client with your API token

client = Endee(token="your-token-here")

# List existing indexes

indexes = client.list_indexes()

# Create a new index

client.create_index(

    name="my_vectors",

    dimension=1536,       # Your vector dimension

    space_type="cosine",  # Distance metric (cosine, l2, ip)

    precision="medium"      # Precision level (recommended)

)

# Get index reference

index = client.get_index(name="my_vectors")

# Insert vectors

index.upsert([

    {

        "id": "doc1",

        "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...],  # Your vector data

        "meta": {"text": "Example document", "category": "reference"},

        "filter": {"category": "reference", "tags": "important"}

    }

])

# Query similar vectors with filtering

results = index.query(

    vector=[0.2, 0.3, 0.4, ...],  # Query vector

    top_k=10,

    filter=[{"category": {"$eq": "reference"}}]  # Structured filter

)

# Process results

for item in results:

    print(f"ID: {item['id']}, Similarity: {item['similarity']}")

    print(f"Metadata: {item['meta']}")

```

## Basic Usage

To interact with the Endee platform, you'll need to authenticate using an API token. This token is used to securely identify your workspace and authorize all actions — including index creation, vector upserts, and queries.

### 🔐 Generate Your API Token

You can create and manage your authentication tokens from the **Endee Dashboard** under the **API Keys** section.

- Each token is tied to your workspace and should be kept private

- Once you have your token, you're ready to initialize the client and begin using the SDK

### Initializing the Client

The Endee client acts as the main interface for all vector operations — such as creating indexes, upserting vectors, and running similarity queries. You can initialize the client in just a few lines:

```python

from endee.endee import Endee

# Initialize with your API token

client = Endee(token="your-token-here")

```

### Listing All Indexes

The `client.list_indexes()` method returns a list of all the indexes currently available in your environment or workspace. This is useful for managing, debugging, or programmatically selecting indexes for vector operations like upsert or search.

```python

from endee.endee import Endee

client = Endee(token="your-token-here")

# List all indexes in your workspace

indexes = client.list_indexes()

```

### Create an Index

The `client.create_index()` method initializes a new vector index with customizable parameters such as dimensionality, distance metric, graph construction settings, and precision level. These configurations determine how the index stores and retrieves high-dimensional vector data.

```python

from endee.endee import Endee

client = Endee(token="your-token-here")

# Create an index with custom parameters

client.create_index(

    name="my_custom_index",

    dimension=768,

    space_type="cosine",

    M=16,              # Graph connectivity parameter (default = 16)

    ef_con=128,        # Construction-time parameter (default = 128)

    precision="medium"   # Precision level (recommended)

)

```

**Parameters:**

- `name`: Unique name for your index (alphanumeric + underscores, max 48 chars)

- `dimension`: Vector dimensionality (must match your embedding model's output, max 10000)

- `space_type`: Distance metric - `"cosine"`, `"l2"`, or `"ip"` (inner product)

- `M`: HNSW graph connectivity parameter - higher values increase recall but use more memory (default: 16)

- `ef_con`: HNSW construction parameter - higher values improve index quality but slow down indexing (default: 128)

- `precision`: Vector precision level - `"medium"` (default), `"high"`, `"fp16"`, or `"ultra-high"`

- `key`: Optional encryption key for client-side encryption (if None, index is not encrypted)

- `version`: Optional version parameter for index versioning

**Precision Levels:**

The `precision` parameter controls how vectors are stored internally, affecting memory usage and search accuracy.

| Precision | Quantization | Data Type | Memory Usage | Accuracy | Use Case |

|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------------|----------|----------|

| `"ultra-high"` | 32-bit | FP32 | Highest | Maximum | When accuracy is absolutely critical |

| `"fp16"` | 16-bit | FP16 | ~50% less | Excellent | Best balance of accuracy and memory |

| `"high"` | 16-bit | INT16 | ~50% less | Very good | Good accuracy with memory savings |

| `"medium"` | 8-bit | INT8 | ~75% less | Good | **Default** - great for most use cases |

**Choosing the Right Precision:**

- **`"medium"`**: **Default and recommended for most use cases** - provides good accuracy with significant memory savings using 8-bit integer quantization

- **`"fp16"`**: Use when you need higher accuracy with 16-bit floating point

- **`"high"`**: Good balance using 16-bit integer quantization

- **`"ultra-high"`**: Use when you need maximum accuracy and have sufficient memory (32-bit float)

### Get an Index

The `client.get_index()` method retrieves a reference to an existing index. This is required before performing vector operations like upsert, query, or delete.

```python

from endee.endee import Endee

client = Endee(token="your-token-here")

# Get reference to an existing index

index = client.get_index(name="my_custom_index")

# Now you can perform operations on the index

print(index.describe())

```

**Parameters:**

- `name`: Name of the index to retrieve

- `key`: Encryption key used when creating the index (required if index was created with encryption, pass `None` for unencrypted indexes)

**Returns:** An `Index` instance configured with server parameters

> **Note:** The key must match the key used when creating the index. If the checksum doesn't match, an error will be raised.

### Ingestion of Data

The `index.upsert()` method is used to add or update vectors (embeddings) in an existing index. Each vector is represented as an object containing a unique identifier, the vector data itself, optional metadata, and optional filter fields for future querying.

```python

from endee.endee import Endee

client = Endee(token="your-token-here")

# Accessing the index

index = client.get_index(name="your-index-name")

# Insert multiple vectors in a batch

index.upsert([

    {

        "id": "vec1",

        "vector": [...],  # Your vector

        "meta": {"title": "First document"},

        "filter": {"tags": "important"}  # Optional filter values

    },

    {

        "id": "vec2",

        "vector": [...],  # Another vector

        "meta": {"title": "Second document"},

        "filter": {"visibility": "public", "tags": "important"}

    }

])

```

**Vector Object Fields:**

- `id`: Unique identifier for the vector (required)

- `vector`: Array of floats representing the embedding (required)

- `meta`: Arbitrary metadata object for storing additional information (optional)

- `filter`: Key-value pairs for structured filtering during queries (optional)

> **Note:** Maximum batch size is 1000 vectors per upsert call.

### Querying the Index

The `index.query()` method performs a similarity search in the index using a given query vector. It returns the closest vectors (based on the index's distance metric) along with optional metadata and vector data.

```python

from endee.endee import Endee

client = Endee(token="your-token-here")

# Accessing the index

index = client.get_index(name="your-index-name")

# Query with custom parameters

results = index.query(

    vector=[...],         # Query vector

    top_k=5,              # Number of results to return (max 512)

    ef=128,               # Runtime parameter for search quality (max 1024)

    include_vectors=True  # Include vector data in results

)

```

**Query Parameters:**

- `vector`: Query vector (must match index dimension)

- `top_k`: Number of nearest neighbors to return (max 512, default: 10)

- `ef`: Runtime search parameter - higher values improve recall but increase latency (max 1024, default: 128)

- `include_vectors`: Whether to return the actual vector data in results (default: False)

- `filter`: Optional filter criteria (array of filter objects)

- `log`: Optional logging parameter for debugging (default: False)

**Result Fields:**

- `id`: Vector identifier

- `similarity`: Similarity score

- `distance`: Distance score (1.0 - similarity)

- `meta`: Metadata dictionary

- `norm`: Vector norm

- `vector`: Vector data (if `include_vectors=True`)

## Filtered Querying

The `index.query()` method also supports structured filtering using the `filter` parameter. This allows you to restrict search results based on metadata conditions, in addition to vector similarity.

To apply multiple filter conditions, pass an array of filter objects, where each object defines a separate condition. **All filters are combined with logical AND** — meaning a vector must match all specified conditions to be included in the results.

```python

index = client.get_index(name="your-index-name")

# Query with multiple filter conditions (AND logic)

filtered_results = index.query(

    vector=[...],         # Query vector

    top_k=5,              # Number of results to return

    ef=128,               # Runtime parameter for search quality

    include_vectors=True, # Include vector data in results

    filter=[

        {"tags": {"$eq": "important"}},

        {"visibility": {"$eq": "public"}}

    ]

)

```

### Filtering Operators

The `filter` parameter in `index.query()` supports a range of comparison operators to build structured queries. These operators allow you to include or exclude vectors based on metadata or custom fields.

| Operator | Description | Supported Type | Example Usage |

|----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|

| `$eq` | Matches values that are equal | String, Number | `{"status": {"$eq": "published"}}` |

| `$in` | Matches any value in the provided list | String | `{"tags": {"$in": ["ai", "ml"]}}` |

| `$range` | Matches values between a start and end value, inclusive | Number | `{"score": {"$range": [70, 95]}}` |

**Important Notes:**

- Operators are **case-sensitive** and must be prefixed with a `$`

- Filters operate on fields provided under the `filter` key during vector upsert

- The `$range` operator supports values only within the range **[0 – 999]**. If your data exceeds this range (e.g., timestamps, large scores), you should normalize or scale your values to fit within [0, 999] prior to upserting or querying

### Filter Examples

```python

# Equal operator - exact match

filter=[{"status": {"$eq": "published"}}]

# In operator - match any value in list

filter=[{"tags": {"$in": ["ai", "ml", "data-science"]}}]

# Range operator - numeric range (inclusive)

filter=[{"score": {"$range": [70, 95]}}]

# Combined filters (AND logic)

filter=[

    {"status": {"$eq": "published"}},

    {"tags": {"$in": ["ai", "ml"]}},

    {"score": {"$range": [80, 100]}}

]

```

## Deletion Methods

The system supports two types of deletion operations — **vector deletion** and **index deletion**. These allow you to remove specific vectors or entire indexes from your workspace, giving you full control over lifecycle and storage.

### Vector Deletion

Vector deletion is used to remove specific vectors from an index using their unique `id`. This is useful when:

- A document is outdated or revoked

- You want to update a vector by first deleting its old version

- You're cleaning up test data or low-quality entries

```python

from endee.endee import Endee

client = Endee(token="your-token-here")

index = client.get_index(name="your-index-name")

# Delete a single vector by ID

index.delete_vector("vec1")

```

### Filtered Deletion

In cases where you don't know the exact vector `id`, but want to delete vectors based on filter fields, you can use filtered deletion. This is especially useful for:

- Bulk deleting vectors by tag, type, or timestamp

- Enforcing access control or data expiration policies

```python

from endee.endee import Endee

client = Endee(token="your-token-here")

index = client.get_index(name="your-index-name")

# Delete all vectors matching filter conditions

index.delete_with_filter([{"tags": {"$eq": "important"}}])

```

### Index Deletion

Index deletion permanently removes the entire index and all vectors associated with it. This should be used when:

- The index is no longer needed

- You want to re-create the index with a different configuration

- You're managing index rotation in batch pipelines

```python

from endee.endee import Endee

client = Endee(token="your-token-here")

# Delete an entire index

client.delete_index("your-index-name")

```

> ⚠️ **Caution:** Deletion operations are **irreversible**. Ensure you have the correct `id` or index name before performing deletion, especially at the index level.

## Additional Operations

### Get Vector by ID

The `index.get_vector()` method retrieves a specific vector from the index by its unique identifier.

```python

# Retrieve a specific vector by its ID

vector = index.get_vector("vec1")

# The returned object contains:

# - id: Vector identifier

# - meta: Metadata dictionary

# - filter: Filter fields dictionary

# - norm: Vector norm value

# - vector: Vector data array

```

### Describe Index

```python

# Get index statistics and configuration info

info = index.describe()

```
