# MLGeometry

Higher dimensional computational geometry using machine learning software 

- Kahler geometry and Kahler-Einstein metrics

More to come.

## Recent Changes

The backend of MLGeometry has been switched to 'JAX' from 'Tensorflow' due to the flexibility `JAX` provides and the current trend in the ML community. 
If you prefer the older version, please check the 'Using and Older Version' section below.

## Installation

*Note: This installs the CPU version of JAX by default. If you wish to use a GPU, it is recommended to install the appropriate version of JAX for your hardware before installing this package. Please refer to the [official JAX installation guide](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for instructions.*

You can install MLGeometry using one of the following methods:

### Via PyPI

    pip install MLGeometry-JAX

### Directly from Github

    pip install git+https://github.com/yidiq7/MLGeometry.git

### Using an Older Version

If you prefer to use an older version of MLGeometry based on Tensorflow 2.16+ and Keras 3, you can check out the previous release (v1.2.1) here: [Version 1.2.1 Release](https://github.com/yidiq7/MLGeometry/releases/tag/v1.2.1).

For an older version based on Tensorflow 2.12 and Keras 2, check [Version 1.1.0 Release](https://github.com/yidiq7/MLGeometry/releases/tag/v1.1.0).

Follow the installation instructions provided in that release's documentation. The compatible versions of Python and CUDA can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu).
