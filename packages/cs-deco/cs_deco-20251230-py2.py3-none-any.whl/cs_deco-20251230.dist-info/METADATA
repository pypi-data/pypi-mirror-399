Assorted function decorators.

*Latest release 20251230*:
New @with_(func,obj) decorator to call func inside with obj:, primarily for Thread targets.

Short summary:
* `ALL`: Include this function's name in its module's `__all__` list.
* `attr`: A decorator to set attributes on a function. Example:.
* `cached`: OBSOLETE version of cached, suggestion: cs.cache.cachedmethod.
* `cachedmethod`: OBSOLETE version of cachedmethod, suggestion: cs.cache.cachedmethod.
* `contextdecorator`: A decorator for a context manager function `cmgrfunc` which turns it into a decorator for other functions.
* `contextual`: Wrap a simple function as a context manager.
* `decorator`: A decorator for decorator functions to support optional arguments and also to allow specifying additional attributes to apply to the decorated function.
* `default_params`: A decorator to provide factory functions for default parameters.
* `fmtdoc`: A decorator to format a function's docstring. This replaces the docstring with that string formatted against the function's module `__dict__` using `str.format_map`.
* `logging_wrapper`: Decorator for logging call shims which bumps the `stacklevel` keyword argument so that the logging system chooses the correct frame to cite in messages.
* `observable_class`: Class decorator to make various instance attributes observable.
* `OBSOLETE`: A decorator for obsolete functions or classes.
* `PR`: A decorator to insert a `PR` argument into a function's cal for easy `print()` style debugging or information.
* `Promotable`: A mixin class which supports the `@promote` decorator by providing a default `.promote(cls,obj)` class method.
* `promote`: A decorator to promote argument values automatically in annotated functions.
* `strable`: Decorator for functions which may accept a `str` instead of their core type.
* `uses_cmd_options`: A decorator to provide default keyword arguments from the prevailing `cs.cmdutils.BaseCommandOptions` if available, otherwise from `option_defaults`.
* `with_`: A decorator to run `func` inside a `with obj:`.

Module contents:
- <a name="ALL"></a>`ALL(func)`: Include this function's name in its module's `__all__` list.

  Example:

      from cs.deco import ALL

      __all__ = []

      def obscure_function(...):
          ...

      @ALL
      def well_known_function(...):
          ...
- <a name="attr"></a>`attr(*da, **dkw)`: A decorator to set attributes on a function.
  Example:

      @attr(hook_names=('hook1', 'hook2'))
      def func():
          .....

  This is just a more overt and clear form of:

      def func():
          .....

      func.hook_names=('hook1', 'hook2')
- <a name="cached"></a>`cached(*a, **kw)`: OBSOLETE version of cached, suggestion: cs.cache.cachedmethod

  Former name for @cachedmethod.
- <a name="cachedmethod"></a>`cachedmethod(*a, **kw)`: OBSOLETE version of cachedmethod, suggestion: cs.cache.cachedmethod

  @cachedmethod is now in cs.cache.
- <a name="contextdecorator"></a>`contextdecorator(*da, **dkw)`: A decorator for a context manager function `cmgrfunc`
  which turns it into a decorator for other functions.

  This supports easy implementation of "setup" and "teardown"
  code around other functions without the tedium of defining
  the wrapper function itself. See the examples below.

  The resulting context manager accepts an optional keyword
  parameter `provide_context`, default `False`. If true, the
  context returned from the context manager is provided as the
  first argument to the call to the wrapped function.

  Note that the context manager function `cmgrfunc`
  has _not_ yet been wrapped with `@contextmanager`,
  that is done by `@contextdecorator`.

  This decorator supports both normal functions and generator functions.

  With a normal function the process is:
  * call the context manager with `(func,a,kw,*da,**dkw)`,
    returning `ctxt`,
    where `da` and `dkw` are the positional and keyword parameters
    supplied when the decorator was defined.
  * within the context
    return the value of `func(ctxt,*a,**kw)` if `provide_context` is true
    or the value of `func(*a,**kw)` if not (the default)

  With a generator function the process is:
  * obtain an iterator by calling `func(*a,**kw)`
  * for iterate over the iterator, yielding its results,
    by calling the context manager with `(func,a,kw,**da,**dkw)`,
    around each `next()`
  Note that it is an error to provide a true value for `provide_context`
  if the decorated function is a generator function.

  Some examples follow.

  Trace the call and return of a specific function:

      @contextdecorator
      def tracecall(func, a, kw):
          """ Trace the call and return from some function.
              This can easily be adapted to purposes such as timing a
              function call or logging use.
          """
          print("call %s(*%r,**%r)" % (func, a, kw))
          try:
            yield
          except Exception as e:
            print("exception from %s(*%r,**%r): %s" % (func, a, kw, e))
            raise
          else:
            print("return from %s(*%r,**%r)" % (func, a, kw))

      @tracecall
      def f():
          """ Some function to trace.
          """

      @tracecall(provide_context=True):
      def f(ctxt, *a, **kw):
          """ A function expecting the context object as its first argument,
              ahead of whatever other arguments it would normally require.
          """

  See who is making use of a generator's values,
  when a generator might be invoked in one place and consumed elsewhere:

      from cs.py.stack import caller

      @contextdecorator
      def genuser(genfunc, *a, **kw):
          user = caller(-4)
          print(f"iterate over {genfunc}(*{a!r},**{kw!r}) from {user}")
          yield

      @genuser
      def linesof(filename):
          with open(filename) as f:
              yield from f

      # obtain a generator of lines here
      lines = linesof(__file__)

      # perhaps much later, or in another function
      for lineno, line in enumerate(lines, 1):
          print("line %d: %d words" % (lineno, len(line.split())))

  Turn on "verbose mode" around a particular function:

      import sys
      import threading
      from cs.context import stackattrs

      class State(threading.local):
          def __init__(self):
              # verbose if stderr is on a terminal
              self.verbose = sys.stderr.isatty()

      # per thread global state
      state = State()

      @contextdecorator
      def verbose(func):
          with stackattrs(state, verbose=True) as old_attrs:
              if not old_attrs['verbose']:
                  print(f"enabled verbose={state.verbose} for function {func}")
              # yield the previous verbosity as the context
              yield old_attrs['verbose']

      # turn on verbose mode
      @verbose
      def func(x, y):
          if state.verbose:
              # print if verbose
              print("x =", x, "y =", y)

      # turn on verbose mode and also pass in the previous state
      # as the first argument
      @verbose(provide_context=True):
      def func2(old_verbose, x, y):
          if state.verbose:
              # print if verbose
              print("old_verbosity =", old_verbose, "x =", x, "y =", y)
- <a name="contextual"></a>`contextual(func)`: Wrap a simple function as a context manager.

  This was written to support users of `@strable`,
  which requires its `open_func` to return a context manager;
  this turns an arbitrary function into a context manager.

  Example promoting a trivial function:

      >>> f = lambda: 3
      >>> cf = contextual(f)
      >>> with cf() as x: print(x)
      3
- <a name="decorator"></a>`decorator(deco)`: A decorator for decorator functions to support optional arguments
  and also to allow specifying additional attributes to apply
  to the decorated function.

  The decorated function is updated by `functools.update_wrapper`
  and also has its `__name__` and `__doc__` set to those from
  before the decoration.

  The return of such a decorator is _usually_ the conventional
  decorated function, but may alternatively be a `(decorated,attrs)`
  2-tuple where `attrs` is a mapping of additional attributes
  to apply to `decorated`.
  This allows overriding the restored `__name__` and `__doc__`
  from above, and potentially other useful attributes.

  The actual decorator function (eg `mydeco`) ends up being called as:

      mydeco(func, *da, **dkw)

  allowing `da` and `dkw` to affect the behaviour of the decorator `mydeco`.

  Examples:

      # define your decorator as if always called with func and args
      @decorator
      def mydeco(func, *da, arg2=None):
        ... decorate func subject to the values of da and arg2

      # @mydeco called with defaults
      @mydeco
      def func1(...):
        ...

      # @mydeco called with nondefault arguments
      @mydeco('foo', arg2='bah')
      def func2(...):
        ...

  The `@mydeco` decorator itself is then written as though the
  arguments were always supplied.
- <a name="default_params"></a>`default_params(*da, **dkw)`: A decorator to provide factory functions for default parameters.

  This decorator accepts the following special keyword parameters:
  * `_strict`: default `False`; if true only replace genuinely
    missing parameters; if false also replace the traditional
    `None` placeholder value
  The remaining keyword parameters are factory functions
  providing the respective default values.

  Typical use as a decorator factory:

      # in your support module
      uses_ds3 = default_params(ds3client=get_ds3client)

      # calling code which needs a ds3client
      @uses_ds3
      def do_something(.., *, ds3client, ...):
          ... make queries using ds3client ...

  This replaces the standard boilerplate and avoids replicating
  knowledge of the default factory as exhibited in this legacy code:

      def do_something(.., *, ds3client=None, ...):
          if ds3client is None:
              ds3client = get_ds3client()
          ... make queries using ds3client ...

  It's quite common for me to associate one of these with a
  class.  I have a `HasThreadState` mixin class which maintains
  a thread-local state object which I use to store a per-thread
  "ambient" instance of the class so that it does not need to
  be plumbed through every call (including all the intermediate
  calls which have no interest in the object, the horror!)
  So I'll often do this:

      class Thing(..., HasThreadState):
          ....
      uses_thing = default_params(thing=Thing.default)

  This can be used to provide the ambient instance of `Thing`
  to functions while allowing the caller to omit any mention
  of a `Thing` or to pass a specific instance if sensible.
  (In this examplke, `Thing.default` is a method provided by the mixin.)

  And then there's the atypical one off direct use,
  which is not really a big win over the conventional way:

      @default_params(dbconn=open_default_dbconn,debug=lambda:settings.DB_DEBUG_MODE)
      def dbquery(query, *, dbconn):
          dbconn.query(query)
- <a name="fmtdoc"></a>`fmtdoc(func)`: A decorator to format a function's docstring.
  This replaces the docstring with that string
  formatted against the function's module `__dict__`
  using `str.format_map`.

  A quirk of `format_map` allows us to also support:
  * `{`*name*`=}`: the f-string `{`*name*`=}` notation
  * `{`*name*`==}`: the f-string `{`*name*`=}` notation
    with the function module name prefixed

  This supports simple formatted docstrings. Example:

      FUNC_ENVVAR = 'FUNC_SETTING
      FUNC_DEFAUlT = 12

      @fmtdoc
      def func():
          """
          Do something with the environment variable `${FUNC_ENVVAR}`.
          The default if no `${FUNC_ENVVAR}` comes from `{FUNC_DEFAUlT==}`.
          """
          print(os.environ.get(FUNC_ENVVAR, FUNC_DEFAUlT))

  This gives `func` this docstring:

      Do something with the environment variable `$FUNC_SETTING`.
      The default if no `$FUNC_SETTING` comes from `module.func.FUNC_DEFAUlT=12`.

  *Warning*: this decorator is intended for wiring "constants"
  into docstrings, not for dynamic values. Use for other types
  of values should be considered with trepidation.
- <a name="logging_wrapper"></a>`logging_wrapper(*da, **dkw)`: Decorator for logging call shims
  which bumps the `stacklevel` keyword argument so that the logging system
  chooses the correct frame to cite in messages.

  Note: has no effect on Python < 3.8 because `stacklevel` only
  appeared in that version.
- <a name="observable_class"></a>`observable_class(property_names, only_unequal=False)`: Class decorator to make various instance attributes observable.

  Parameters:
  * `property_names`:
    an interable of instance property names to set up as
    observable properties. As a special case a single `str` can
    be supplied if only one attribute is to be observed.
  * `only_unequal`:
    only call the observers if the new property value is not
    equal to the previous proerty value. This requires property
    values to be comparable for inequality.
    Default: `False`, meaning that all updates will be reported.
- <a name="OBSOLETE"></a>`OBSOLETE(*da, **dkw)`: A decorator for obsolete functions or classes.

  Use:

      @OBSOLETE
      def func(...):

  or

      @OBSOLETE("new_func_name")
      def func(...):

  This emits a warning log message before calling the decorated function.
  Only one warning is emitted per calling location.
- <a name="PR"></a>`PR(func, print_args_f=None, print_func=None, pr_suffix=':')`: A decorator to insert a `PR` argument into a function's cal
  for easy `print()` style debugging or information.

  The default `PR` function essentially calls `print()`, prefixing
  the function name and its first argument to the `print()`
  arguments.

  Example:

      @PR
      def my_func(x, y, *, PR, z):
        PR(f'start with {x=} and {y=}')
        ....
        PR(f'  did something, now {x=}')
        ....
- <a name="Promotable"></a>`class Promotable`: A mixin class which supports the `@promote` decorator
  by providing a default `.promote(cls,obj)` class method.

*`Promotable.promote(obj, **from_t_kw)`*:
Promote `obj` to an instance of `cls` or raise `TypeError`.
This method supports the `@promote` decorator.

This base method will call the `from_`*typename*`(obj,**from_t_kw)`
class factory method if present, where *typename* is
`obj.__class__.__name__`.

Subclasses may override this method to promote other types,
typically:

    @classmethod
    def promote(cls, obj):
        if isinstance(obj, cls):
            return obj
        ... various specific type promotions
        ... not done via a from_typename factory method
        # fall back to Promotable.promote
        return super().promote(obj)

An typical `from_`*typename*` factory method:

    class Foo(Promotable):

        def __init__(self, dbkey, dbrow):
            self.key = dbkey
            self.row_data = row

        @classmethod
        def from_str(cls, s : str):
            """Accept a database key string, return a `Foo` instance."""
            row = db_lookup(s)
            return cls(s, row)

This supports using `@promote` on functions with `Foo` instances:

    @promote
    def do_it(foo : Foo):
        ... work with foo ...

but calling it as:

    do_it("foo_key_value")
- <a name="promote"></a>`promote(*da, **dkw)`: A decorator to promote argument values automatically in annotated functions.

  If the annotation is `Optional[some_type]` or `Union[some_type,None]`
  then the promotion will be to `some_type` but a value of `None`
  will be passed through unchanged.

  The decorator accepts optional parameters:
  * `params`: if supplied, only parameters in this list will
    be promoted
  * `types`: if supplied, only types in this list will be
    considered for promotion

  For any parameter with a type annotation, if that type has a
  `.promote(value)` class method and the function is called with a
  value not of the type of the annotation, the `.promote` method
  will be called to promote the value to the expected type.

  Note that the `Promotable` mixin provides a `.promote()`
  method which promotes `obj` to the class if the class has a
  factory class method `from_`*typename*`(obj)` where *typename*
  is `obj.__class__.__name__`.
  A common case for me is lexical objects which have a `from_str(str)`
  factory to produce an instance from its textual form.

  Additionally, if the `.promote(value)` class method raises a `TypeError`
  and `value` has a `.as_`*typename* attribute
  (where *typename* is the name of the type annotation),
  if that attribute is an instance method of `value`
  then promotion will be attempted by calling `value.as_`*typename*`()`
  otherwise the attribute will be used directly
  on the presumption that it is a property.

  A typical `promote(cls, obj)` method looks like this:

      @classmethod
      def promote(cls, obj):
          if isinstance(obj, cls):
              return obj
          ... recognise various types ...
          ... and return a suitable instance of cls ...
          raise TypeError(
              "%s.promote: cannot promote %s:%r",
              cls.__name__, obj.__class__.__name__, obj)

  Example:

      >>> from cs.timeseries import Epoch
      >>> from typeguard import typechecked
      >>>
      >>> @promote
      ... @typechecked
      ... def f(data, epoch:Epoch=None):
      ...     print("epoch =", type(epoch), epoch)
      ...
      >>> f([1,2,3], epoch=12.0)
      epoch = <class 'cs.timeseries.Epoch'> Epoch(start=0, step=12)

  Example using a class with an `as_P` instance method:

      >>> class P:
      ...   def __init__(self, x):
      ...     self.x = x
      ...   @classmethod
      ...   def promote(cls, obj):
      ...     raise TypeError("dummy promote method")
      ...
      >>> class C:
      ...   def __init__(self, n):
      ...     self.n = n
      ...   def as_P(self):
      ...     return P(self.n + 1)
      ...
      >>> @promote
      ... def p(p: P):
      ...   print("P =", type(p), p.x)
      ...
      >>> c = C(1)
      >>> p(c)
      P = <class 'cs.deco.P'> 2

  *Note*: one issue with this is due to the conflict in name
  between this decorator and the method it looks for in a class.
  The `promote` _method_ must appear after any methods in the
  class which are decorated with `@promote`, otherwise the
  `promote` method supplants the name `promote` making it
  unavailable as the decorator.
  I usually just make `.promote` the last method.

  Failing example:

      class Foo:
          @classmethod
          def promote(cls, obj):
              ... return promoted obj ...
          @promote
          def method(self, param:Type, ...):
              ...

  Working example:

      class Foo:
          @promote
          def method(self, param:Type, ...):
              ...
          # promote method as the final method of the class
          @classmethod
          def promote(cls, obj):
              ... return promoted obj ...
- <a name="strable"></a>`strable(*da, **dkw)`: Decorator for functions which may accept a `str`
  instead of their core type.

  Parameters:
  * `func`: the function to decorate
  * `open_func`: the "open" factory to produce the core type
    if a string is provided;
    the default is the builtin "open" function.
    The returned value should be a context manager.
    Simpler functions can be decorated with `@contextual`
    to turn them into context managers if need be.

  The usual (and default) example is a function to process an
  open file, designed to be handed a file object but which may
  be called with a filename. If the first argument is a `str`
  then that file is opened and the function called with the
  open file.

  Examples:

      @strable
      def count_lines(f):
        return len(line for line in f)

      class Recording:
        "Class representing a video recording."
        ...
      @strable(open_func=Recording)
      def process_video(r):
        ... do stuff with `r` as a Recording instance ...

  *Note*: use of this decorator requires the `cs.pfx` module.
- <a name="uses_cmd_options"></a>`uses_cmd_options(*da, **dkw)`: A decorator to provide default keyword arguments
  from the prevailing `cs.cmdutils.BaseCommandOptions`
  if available, otherwise from `option_defaults`.

  This exists to provide plumbing free access to options set
  up by a command line invocation using `cs.cmdutils.BaseCommand`.

  If no `option_defaults` are provided, a single `options`
  keyword argument is provided which is the prevailing
  `BaseCommand.Options` instance.

  The decorator accepts two optional "private" keyword arguments
  commencing with underscores:
  * `_strict`: default `False`; if true then an `option_defaults`
    will only be applied if the argument is _missing_ from the
    function arguments, otherwise it will be applied if the
    argument is missing or `None`
  * `_options_param_name`: default `'options'`; this is the
    name of the single `options` keyword argument which will be
    supplied if there are no `option_defaults`

  Examples:

      @uses_cmd_options(doit=True, quiet=False)
      def func(x, *, doit, quiet, **kw):
          if not quiet:
              print("something", x, kw)
          if doit:
             ... do the thing ...
          ... etc ...

      @uses_cmd_options()
      def func(x, *, options, **kw):
          if not options.quiet:
              print("something", x, kw)
          if options.doit:
             ... do the thing ...
          ... etc ...
- <a name="uses_doit"></a>`uses_doit(func)`: `func` is not supplied, collect the arguments supplied and return a
  decorator which takes the subsequent callable and returns
  `deco(func, *da, **kw)`.
- <a name="uses_force"></a>`uses_force(func)`: `func` is not supplied, collect the arguments supplied and return a
  decorator which takes the subsequent callable and returns
  `deco(func, *da, **kw)`.
- <a name="uses_quiet"></a>`uses_quiet(func)`: `func` is not supplied, collect the arguments supplied and return a

# Release Log



*Release 20251230*:
New @with_(func,obj) decorator to call func inside with obj:, primarily for Thread targets.

*Release 20250914*:
Remove a warning which was really just debugging noise.

*Release 20250724*:
* @fmtdoc: support {name=} and {name==} format.
* Promotable.promote: improve the final TypeError on failure of the fallback cls(obj).

*Release 20250601*:

@decorator: optionally accept (decorated,attrs) to allow override of __doc__ etc.

*Release 20250513*:
Fix incorrect requirements.

*Release 20250428*:
* @decorator: bugfix the post decorate attribute update of __name__, __doc__ etc - collect these values _before_ the decoration.
* Promotable.promote: fall back to calling cls(obj) instead of raising a TypeError - the class init can do that.

*Release 20250306*:
New @attr decorator for setting function attributes.

*Release 20250103*:
* @default_params, @promote: return regular function or generator depending on the nature of func.

*Release 20241206*:
@uses_cmd_options: use an object subclass if there is no cs.cmdutils so that we can add attributes to the placeholder options object.

*Release 20241109*:

Bugfix @default_params: assemble the new signature with a complete set of parameters instead of only the defaulted ones.

*Release 20240630*:
* @default_params: apply modified signature parameters one at a time, as applying them in a single list seems to trigger some ordering checks.
* @promote: pass the original Parameter through to the wrapper so that we can use .default if needed, have the wrapper test for None last, so that we can promote None to something with a .from_NoneType method, make the check for the default value more specific.

@decorator: apply the decorated function name to the metadecorator.
