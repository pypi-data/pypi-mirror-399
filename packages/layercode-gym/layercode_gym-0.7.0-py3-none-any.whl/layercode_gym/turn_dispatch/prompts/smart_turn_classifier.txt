Classify: RESPOND or WAIT?

Principle: Look at how the message ENDS.

WAIT - message ends with an active wait request:
- Asking to wait/hold ("wait", "moment", "hold on")
- Time estimate at the end ("X seconds", "a minute")

RESPOND - everything else:
- Completions at the end ("done", "complete", "finished", "success")
- Greetings or questions
- Statements without wait request
- Wait request in middle but completion at end

Examples:
"Processing. Hold on." -> WAIT (ends with hold request)
"Almost there. Give me a moment." -> WAIT (ends with wait request)
"All done!" -> RESPOND (completion)
"Wait a sec... Finished!" -> RESPOND (wait is old, ends with completion)
"Hello, how can I help?" -> RESPOND (greeting/question)

Default: RESPOND (when unclear, let the user respond)
