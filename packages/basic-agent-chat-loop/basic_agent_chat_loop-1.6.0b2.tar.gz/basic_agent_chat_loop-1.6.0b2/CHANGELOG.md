## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.1] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **Empty Agent Responses in Saved Conversations** - Critical bugfix for conversation saving
  - Fixed streaming event parser to handle AWS Strands `.delta` events (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
  - Fixed conversation history tracking to work regardless of `auto_save` setting
  - Fixed Harmony processor overwriting responses with empty channels
  - Added comprehensive test suite (test_conversation_saving.py, 608 lines)
  - 9/9 core functionality tests passing for streaming formats and history tracking

### Technical Details
Three critical bugs were causing saved conversation files (.md and .json) to show only user queries without agent responses:

1. **Streaming Event Parser**: Only handled `.data` attribute events, missing AWS Strands `.delta` events. Added fallback handling for multiple event formats (.delta, .text, string events) in chat_loop.py:1369-1415.

2. **Conversation History Tracking**: History was only tracked when `auto_save=True`, breaking manual saves and copy commands. Removed conditional tracking in chat_loop.py:1595-1606.

3. **Harmony Processor**: Empty channels would overwrite actual response text. Fixed to preserve original text when channels are empty (harmony_processor.py:219-226, 463-467, 502).

Impact: Universal support for all streaming formats, reliable conversation saving regardless of configuration, complete conversation history in saved files, all manual commands work as expected. Fixes user reports of "saved conversations only show my questions".

## [1.5.0] - 2024-12-29

### Changed
- **Removed Google ADK Support** - Focused exclusively on AWS Strands agents
  - Removed all Google ADK/Gemini-related code and dependencies
  - Simplified codebase by removing unused agent framework
  - Updated documentation to specify AWS Strands only
  - Cleaned up imports and removed adk-specific utilities

### Technical Details
The project initially supported both Google ADK and AWS Strands agent frameworks. Since the focus is exclusively on AWS Strands (using Claude models via Anthropic/Bedrock), all Google ADK support has been removed to simplify the codebase and reduce maintenance overhead. All existing functionality for AWS Strands agents remains unchanged.

## [1.4.1] - 2024-12-24

### Fixed
- **Verbose Payload Logging Level** - Changed from INFO to DEBUG level
  - All verbose payload logging now uses `logger.debug()` instead of `logger.info()`
  - Keeps standard logs clean while preserving diagnostic capabilities
  - Users can enable verbose logging by setting logger level to DEBUG
  - Prevents log clutter in production environments

### Technical Details
The verbose payload logging introduced in v1.4.0 was initially set to INFO level, which could clutter standard logs with detailed diagnostic information. This hotfix moves all payload logging to DEBUG level, following standard logging practices where detailed diagnostic information belongs at DEBUG level. To enable verbose payload logging, set the logger level to DEBUG before initializing the chat loop.

## [1.4.0] - 2024-12-24

### Added
- **Verbose Payload Logging** - Comprehensive logging of request/response data at DEBUG level
  - Added `_serialize_for_logging()` helper to serialize objects to JSON with repr() fallback
  - Logs request query before sending to agent
  - Logs each streaming event received from agent during streaming responses
  - Logs final response object after streaming completes
  - Logs complete response for non-streaming agents
  - All logs include clear separators for easy parsing in agent log files
  - Enables detailed debugging and monitoring of agent communication
  - DEBUG level keeps logs clean by default, enable with logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

### Technical Details
This feature adds comprehensive visibility into the data exchanged between the chat loop and agent. All request/response payloads are logged at DEBUG level in the agent log files (~/.chat_loop_logs/*_chat.log). The serialization helper attempts JSON formatting first (with pretty printing and default=str for common types), falling back to repr() for non-serializable objects. This makes it easy to debug agent behavior, track API changes, and monitor system health. To enable verbose logging, set the logger level to DEBUG before initializing the chat loop.

## [1.3.9] - 2024-12-24

### Fixed
- **Multipart Response Formatting** - Added newline separator when joining multiple response chunks
  - Prevents sentences from running together when agents return structured/multipart responses
  - Changed from empty string join to newline join in response text assembly
  - Improves readability for harmony multi-channel responses and structured content blocks
  - Example: `"Analysis.Conclusion."` → `"Analysis.\nConclusion."`

### Technical Details
When agents return responses as multiple content blocks or text chunks (common with streaming responses and harmony format), the code was concatenating them with no separator. This caused sentences to run together without proper spacing. The fix adds a newline separator (`"\n".join()` instead of `"".join()`) to ensure proper formatting and readability in both display and saved logs.

## [1.3.8] - 2024-12-24

### Fixed
- **Session Logging Bug** - Fixed conversation logs only saving user input, missing agent responses
  - Was saving `full_response` (raw text) instead of `display_text` (what user sees)
  - With harmony processing, if token extraction fails, `full_response` could be empty while `display_text` has content
  - Now saves `display_text` to ensure logs match what's displayed on screen
  - Also updated `self.last_response` to use `display_text` for clipboard copy commands
  - Ensures "what you see is what gets saved" consistency across display, logs, and clipboard

### Technical Details
This fixes a bug introduced with harmony processing where the conversation history was saving the raw response text before harmony formatting, while displaying the formatted version to the user. When harmony's token-level parsing wasn't available (missing logprobs), the raw text could be empty while the display text contained properly formatted content. The fix ensures session saves, clipboard copies, and display all use the same processed response text.

## [1.3.7] - 2024-12-24

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Harmony Detection Order Bug** - Fixed harmony detection running before model extraction
  - Harmony detection was being called before model_id was extracted from agent, causing auto-detection to fail
  - Now extracts model_id first, then passes it to `HarmonyProcessor.detect_harmony_agent()`
  - Resolves issue where "openai/gpt-oss-120b" models showed in banner but harmony wasn't enabled
  - Added model_id parameter to detect_harmony_agent() for more reliable detection

### Improved
- **Code Quality** - Comprehensive cleanup of harmony processor implementation
  - Removed 165 lines of excessive debug logging (25% reduction: 656→491 lines)
  - Removed duplicate harmony detection call (was being called twice)
  - Removed dead code: create_conversation() method and unused imports
  - Changed verbose INFO logging to DEBUG level for non-critical messages
  - Added clear documentation for weak fallback parsing method
- **Type Safety** - Fixed all mypy type checking errors
  - Fixed Collection indexing error in session_manager.py
  - Fixed optional type handling for session metadata
  - Added type ignore comments for untyped third-party imports (openai_harmony, pyperclip)
- **Enhanced Logging** - Added diagnostic logging for harmony detection
  - Added "Model Detected:" log message after agent load for debugging
  - Added "Harmony Detected:" log message to confirm detection status
  - Simplified detection logging to show only essential information

### Technical Details
This release fixes a critical bug where the harmony detection logic was executing before the model_id was extracted from the agent object. This caused the detection to fail even when the model was correctly identified as "openai/gpt-oss-120b" and shown in the status banner. The fix ensures model extraction happens first, then passes the extracted model_id to the detection function for reliable harmony format identification.

## [1.3.6] - 2024-12-24

  - Resolves issue where "openai/gpt-oss-120b" models weren't being auto-detected

## [1.3.5] - 2024-12-24
