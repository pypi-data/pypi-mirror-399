# simple-usage-monitor
## In-terminal (HUD) usage monitoring for Claude Code - see your costs without leaving your workflow

Unlike other monitoring tools that require opening separate dashboards or browsers, **sumonitor displays your usage data right in your terminal in real-time** as you work. No context switching.

- Live token counts (input, output, cache)
- Cost tracking with tiered pricing
- Session limits based on your plan
- Time until session reset

All processing happens locally on your device - your sessions remain completely private.

### Supported Models
1. Opus 4.5
2. Sonnet 4.5
3. Haiku 4.5

Other models will still have accurate token counting, just not dollar cost.
