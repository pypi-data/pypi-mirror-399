How to Use
==========

*NiQuery* is a command-line tool for indexing, collecting, analyzing,
and selecting datasets from a remote neuroimaging data server, such as
OpenNeuro_. The typical workflow consists of five stages:

  #. **Index**: Retrieve available datasets and snapshot information
     from the remote server.
  #. **Collect**: Gather per-dataset modality file listings.
  #. **Analyze**: Extract features from collected files.
  #. **Select**: Choose datasets that satisfy specific constraints.
  #. **Aggregate**: Aggregate the selected datasets into a DataLad
     dataset.

The remote server is expected to allow being queried using GraphQL_,
and the NIfTI files are expected to follow BIDS_ naming conventions
for filtering purposes. An example of GraphQL_ queries for OpenNeuro_
can be found at the `OpenNeuro API <https://docs.openneuro.org/api.html#graphql-playground>`__.

Below are example calls to perform the *NiQuery* actions:

**Index**::

  niquery index openneuro openneuro_datasets.tsv

**Collect**::

  niquery collect \
    openneuro_datasets.tsv \
    ./dataset_files \
    --species human \
    --modality bold \
    --modality fmri \
    --modality mri

``collect`` traverses all trees for all datasets of interest in order
to gather the paths to the ``NIfTI`` files. Note that this process can
take several hours.

**Analyze**::

  niquery analyze ./dataset_files ./dataset_features --suffix bold

**Select**::

  niquery select \
    ./dataset_features selected_openneuro_datasets.tsv 1234 \
    --total-runs 4000 \
    --contr-fraction 0.05 \
    --min-timepoints 300 \
    --max-timepoints 1200

**Aggregate**::

  niquery aggregate selected_openneuro_datasets.tsv ./aggregated_datasets dsresearch
