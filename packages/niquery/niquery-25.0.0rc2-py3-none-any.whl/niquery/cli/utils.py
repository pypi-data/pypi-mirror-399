    Creates a Click command decorator to add an option that can be used to
    enable or disable the ability to forcefully overwrite existing output files,
    for example. The value of this option is stored in the Click context object
    and can be accessed during the command execution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : :obj:`~collections.abc.Callable`
        The function to be wrapped with the Click option.

    -------
    :obj:`~collections.abc.Callable`
