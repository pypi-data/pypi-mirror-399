    These constants define the default safety limits for processing streams
    and extracting blocks. They are used as defaults in ProcessorConfig.

    Attributes:
        MAX_BLOCK_SIZE: Maximum block size in bytes (1 MiB).
            Blocks exceeding this limit are rejected to prevent memory exhaustion.
        MAX_LINE_LENGTH: Maximum line length in bytes (16 KiB).
            Lines exceeding this limit are truncated to prevent memory issues.
        HASH_PREFIX_LENGTH: Number of characters used for hash computation (64).
            Used when generating block IDs from content hash.
        LINES_BUFFER: Default number of recent lines to keep in buffer (5).
            Used for debugging and error context.
