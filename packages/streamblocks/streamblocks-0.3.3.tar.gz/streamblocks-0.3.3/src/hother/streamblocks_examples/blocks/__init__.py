"""Block collections for StreamBlocks.

This module provides block definitions organized by application domain.
Blocks are not part of the core StreamBlocks library - they are examples
of how to build domain-specific blocks using the core primitives.

Available block collections:
- agent: Blocks for AI agent applications (messages, tool calls, memory, etc.)

Usage:
    from hother.streamblocks_examples.blocks.agent import FileOperations, Message, ToolCall
