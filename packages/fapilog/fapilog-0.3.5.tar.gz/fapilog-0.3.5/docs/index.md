# Fapilog - Production-ready logging for the modern Python stack

**fapilog** is a high-performance logging pipeline that eliminates the bottlenecks of traditional Python logging. By replacing blocking I/O with a lock-free, async-native architecture, it ensures your application never stalls to write a log. While it’s an excellent choice for FastAPI and microservices, its lightweight footprint and pluggable sinks make it equally powerful for on-prem, desktop, or embedded projects.

**Stability:** Core logger and FastAPI middleware are beta/stable under semver; the plugin marketplace remains experimental and may change.

## Why Fapilog?

Traditional logging libraries block your application, lose context, and produce unstructured output. Fapilog gives you:

- **🚀 Async-first** - Never block your application again
- **📊 Structured** - JSON logs that machines can actually parse
- **🔒 Production-ready** - Built-in redaction, metrics, and resilience
- **⚡ High-performance** - Lock-free queues and zero-copy processing

## Quick Example

```python
from fapilog import get_async_logger

# Zero-config, works immediately (async)
logger = await get_async_logger()
await logger.info("User logged in", user_id="123")

# Automatic context binding
await logger.error("Database connection failed", exc_info=True)
```

**Output:**

```json
{"timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.123Z", "level": "INFO", "message": "User logged in", "user_id": "123"}
{"timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:01.456Z", "level": "ERROR", "message": "Database connection failed", "exception": "..."}
```
