## LocoFormer (wip)

[LocoFormer - Generalist Locomotion via Long-Context Adaptation](https://generalist-locomotion.github.io/)

The gist is they trained a simple Transformer-XL in simulation on robots with many different bodies (cross-embodiment) and extreme domain randomization. When transferring to the real-world, they noticed the robot now gains the ability to adapt to insults. The XL memories span across multiple trials, which allowed the robot to learn in-context adaptation.
