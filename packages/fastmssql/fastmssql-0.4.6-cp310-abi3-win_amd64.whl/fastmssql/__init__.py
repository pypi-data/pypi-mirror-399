with minimal Python overhead for maximum performance. Built on top of the
tiberius crate, it offers both synchronous and asynchronous database operations
with advanced features like connection pooling, SSL/TLS configuration, and
efficient parameter handling.

Key Features:
    - High-performance Rust backend with Python bindings
    - Async/await support for non-blocking operations
    - Connection pooling with configurable parameters
    - SSL/TLS encryption with certificate validation
    - Parameterized queries with automatic type conversion
    - Memory-efficient result iteration
    - Comprehensive error handling and logging

Basic Usage (Async):
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> from fastmssql import Connection
    >>> 
    >>> async def main():
    ...     async with Connection("Server=localhost;Database=test;Trusted_Connection=yes") as conn:
    ...         # SELECT queries - use query() method
    ...         result = await conn.query("SELECT * FROM users")
    ...         async for row in result:
    ...             print(f"User: {row['name']}, Age: {row['age']}")
    ...         
    ...         # Parameterized SELECT query
    ...         result = await conn.query(
    ...             "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > @P1 AND city = @P2", 
    ...             [18, "New York"]
    ...         )
    ...         rows = await result.fetchall()
    ...         print(f"Found {len(rows)} users")
    ...         
    ...         # INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE - use execute() method
    ...         affected = await conn.execute(
    ...             "INSERT INTO users (name, email, age) VALUES (@P1, @P2, @P3)",
    ...             ["John Doe", "john@example.com", 30]
    ...         )
    ...         print(f"Inserted {affected} rows")
    >>> 
    >>> asyncio.run(main())

Basic Usage (Sync):
    >>> from fastmssql import Connection
    >>> 
    >>> with Connection("Server=localhost;Database=test;Trusted_Connection=yes") as conn:
    ...     # For SELECT queries, you would typically use the async API
    ...     # Sync usage is primarily for simple operations
    ...     pass  # Connection established and will be closed on exit

Advanced Configuration:
    >>> from fastmssql import Connection, PoolConfig, SslConfig, EncryptionLevel
    >>> 
    >>> # Configure connection pool
    >>> pool_config = PoolConfig(
    ...     max_connections=20,
    ...     min_connections=2,
    ...     acquire_timeout_seconds=30,
    ...     idle_timeout_seconds=600
    ... )
    >>> 
    >>> # Configure SSL/TLS
    >>> ssl_config = SslConfig(
    ...     encryption_level=EncryptionLevel.Required,
    ...     trust_server_certificate=False,
    ...     certificate_path="/path/to/cert.pem"
    ... )
    >>> 
    >>> conn = Connection(
    ...     server="myserver.database.windows.net",
    ...     database="mydatabase",
    ...     username="myuser",
    ...     password="mypassword",
    ...     pool_config=pool_config,
    ...     ssl_config=ssl_config
    ... )

Performance Considerations:
    - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and improve performance
    - Leverage connection pooling for applications with multiple concurrent operations
    - Use async methods for I/O-bound applications to improve throughput
    - Consider batch operations for bulk data manipulation
    - Monitor connection pool statistics to optimize pool configuration

Thread Safety:
    This library is thread-safe and can be used in multi-threaded applications.
    Each Connection instance maintains its own connection pool and can be safely
    shared across threads when using async methods.

# Wrapper class to handle async execution result conversion
class Connection:
    """
    High-performance connection to Microsoft SQL Server.
    
    This class provides a Python wrapper around the Rust-based connection implementation,
    offering both synchronous and asynchronous database operations with advanced features
    like connection pooling, SSL/TLS configuration, and efficient parameter handling.
    
    The Connection class supports multiple initialization patterns:
    1. Connection string-based initialization
    2. Individual parameter initialization 
    3. Advanced configuration with pool and SSL settings
    
    Connection Patterns:
        # Using connection string
        conn = Connection("Server=localhost;Database=test;Trusted_Connection=yes")
        
        # Using individual parameters
        conn = Connection(
            server="localhost", 
            database="test", 
            trusted_connection=True
        )
        
        # Using username/password authentication
        conn = Connection(
            server="myserver.database.windows.net",
            database="mydatabase", 
            username="myuser",
            password="mypassword"
        )
    
    Thread Safety:
        This class is thread-safe and maintains an internal connection pool that can
        be safely accessed from multiple threads when using async methods.
    
    Performance Notes:
        - Async methods are recommended for I/O-bound applications
        - Connection pooling is automatically managed for optimal resource usage
        - Parameterized queries provide better performance and security
        - Results are streamed efficiently to minimize memory usage

        Perform high-performance bulk insert operation for large datasets.
        
        This method is optimized for inserting many rows into a single table with
        maximum performance. It processes data in batches to optimize memory usage
        and network efficiency while maintaining consistency.
        
        Use this method for:
            - Large data imports (CSV, JSON, API data)
            - ETL operations and data migration
            - Batch data processing pipelines
            - Any scenario requiring insertion of many rows
        
        Performance Benefits:
            - Optimized batch processing with configurable batch sizes
            - Minimal memory overhead through streaming processing
            - Single connection usage reduces pool contention

        Performance Tips:
            - Use this method instead of query() for data modification commands
            - For bulk operations, consider using batch processing or table-valued parameters
            - Use transactions for multiple related operations
            - Monitor the returned affected row count for validation
        
        Security Notes:
            - Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks
            - Validate affected row counts match expectations
            - Consider using transactions for data consistency

        Monitoring Best Practices:
            - Monitor pool utilization during peak load periods
            - Set up alerts for utilization > 80% or idle connections < min_idle
            - Track connection acquisition times and pool exhaustion events
            - Use metrics for capacity planning and performance optimization
            - Log pool statistics periodically for historical analysis
        
        Performance Impact:
            - This operation has minimal performance overhead
            - Safe to call frequently for monitoring purposes
            - Does not affect active connections or pool operation
            - Recommended for inclusion in health check endpoints
