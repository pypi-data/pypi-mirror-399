Level 5 Transformative Empathy Demo

Healthcare Handoff Patterns → Software Deployment Safety

This demo shows cross-domain pattern transfer:
1. Analyze healthcare handoff code (learn pattern)
2. Store pattern in long-term memory
3. Analyze software deployment code
4. Retrieve healthcare pattern
5. Apply cross-domain to predict deployment failures
