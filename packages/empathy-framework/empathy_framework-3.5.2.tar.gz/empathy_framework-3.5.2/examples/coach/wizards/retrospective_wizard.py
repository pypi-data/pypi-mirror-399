2. **Gather data** (20 min) - Silent brainstorming on sticky notes
3. **Generate insights** (30 min) - Group and discuss themes
4. **Decide what to do** (25 min) - Action items with owners
5. **Close** (10 min) - Appreciations and next steps

## Format

### Mad 😠 (What frustrated us?)
Post sticky notes about things that made the team angry or frustrated.

Examples:
- Unclear requirements
- Production incidents
- Blocked by dependencies

### Sad 😢 (What disappointed us?)
Post sticky notes about things that were disappointing.

Examples:
- Missed deadline
- Feature cut from release
- Team member left

### Glad 😊 (What went well?)
Post sticky notes about positive experiences.

Examples:
- Successful launch
- Great collaboration
- Solved hard problem

## Discussion Questions
- What patterns do we see?
- What's within our control to change?
- What should we try differently next sprint?

## Action Items Template
- [ ] Action: [Description]
  - Owner: [Name]
  - Due: [Date]

## Format

### START 🚀 (What should we start doing?)
Ideas for new practices or experiments.

Examples:
- Start doing daily standups
- Start using feature flags
- Start pairing on complex features

### STOP 🛑 (What should we stop doing?)

- Stop skipping code reviews
- Stop accepting undefined requirements

### CONTINUE ✅ (What should we keep doing?)
Things that are working well.

Examples:
- Continue weekly knowledge shares

## Prioritization
Vote on top 3 items per category.
Focus on high-impact, low-effort changes first.

## Facilitation Tips
- Give everyone 2 minutes to share per category
- Group similar themes together
- Focus discussion on "Lacked" and "Longed For" for action items

## Action Items
Convert "Lacked" and "Longed For" into concrete actions:
