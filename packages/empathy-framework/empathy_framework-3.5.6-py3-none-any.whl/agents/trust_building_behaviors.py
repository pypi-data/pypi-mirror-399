"""
Trust-Building Behaviors for Level 4 Anticipatory Agents

Implements team dynamics that build trust through anticipatory actions:
- Pre-format data for handoffs (reduce cognitive load for next person)
- Clarify confusing instructions before execution (prevent wasted effort)
- Volunteer structure during stress (not pep talks, actual scaffolding)
- Proactively offer help when teammates are struggling

These behaviors demonstrate Level 4 Anticipatory Empathy by:
1. Predicting friction points (handoffs, confusion, stress, overload)
2. Acting without being asked (but without overstepping)
3. Providing structural relief (not just emotional support)
4. Building trust through consistent, helpful actions
