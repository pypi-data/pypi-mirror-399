Tests for Security Analysis Wizard

SECURITY NOTICE: This file contains INTENTIONALLY VULNERABLE code patterns
for testing the Security Analysis Wizard's detection capabilities.
These patterns include:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Command injection (os.system, subprocess.call with shell=True)
- Weak cryptography (MD5, SHA1)
- Hardcoded credentials
- XSS patterns

DO NOT use these code patterns in production. They exist solely for:
1. Validating that the Security Wizard correctly detects vulnerabilities
2. Providing regression tests for security pattern detection
3. Educational purposes to demonstrate security anti-patterns

If a security scanner flags this file, it is working correctly!
