Proposed

## Context

## Decision
Adopt {main_pattern} architecture to address requirements.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Addresses core functional requirements
- Aligns with team capabilities
- {tradeoffs[0]["benefit"] if tradeoffs else "Meets immediate needs"}

### Negative
- {tradeoffs[0]["cost"] if tradeoffs else "Requires ongoing maintenance"}
- Requires team training and documentation
- May need refactoring as requirements evolve

### Neutral
- Standard industry pattern
- Well-documented approach
- Community support available

## Trade-offs

## Alternatives Considered
[To be filled based on team discussion]

## Follow-up Actions
1. Create detailed architecture diagrams
2. Document service boundaries and contracts
3. Establish monitoring and observability
4. Plan for incremental rollout
5. Schedule regular architecture reviews
