# Reference Project TODOs

## Inline Style Configuration (Phase 2)
- [x] Plan and implement `opencode.json` configuration examples.
- [x] Include granular permission examples in JSON.
- [x] Include tool-specific overrides in JSON.
- [x] Demonstrate variable substitution (`{env:...}`, `{file:...}`) in JSON.
- [x] Include Model Context Protocol (MCP) server examples in JSON.

*Note: LazyOpenCode currently focuses on Markdown-style customizations, so JSON-based configuration needs further planning to ensure full compatibility with the visualizer.*
