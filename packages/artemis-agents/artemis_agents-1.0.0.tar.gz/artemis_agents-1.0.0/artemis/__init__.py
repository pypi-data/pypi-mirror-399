ARTEMIS Agents - Adaptive Reasoning Through Evaluation of Multi-agent Intelligent Systems

A production-ready framework for structured multi-agent debates with adaptive evaluation,
causal reasoning, and built-in safety monitoring.

Example:
    >>> from artemis import Debate, Agent, JuryPanel
    >>>
    >>> agents = [
    ...     Agent(name="Proponent", role="Argues in favor", model="gpt-4o"),
    ...     Agent(name="Opponent", role="Argues against", model="gpt-4o"),
    ... ]
    >>>
    >>> debate = Debate(
    ...     topic="Should AI systems be given legal personhood?",
    ...     agents=agents,
    ...     jury=JuryPanel(evaluators=3),
    ...     rounds=3
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> result = await debate.run()
    >>> print(f"Verdict: {result.verdict.decision}")
