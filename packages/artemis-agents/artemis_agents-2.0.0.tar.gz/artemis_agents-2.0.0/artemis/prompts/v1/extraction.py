For each causal relationship, identify:
1. The cause (what triggers the effect)
2. The effect (what results from the cause)
3. The mechanism (how/why the cause leads to the effect)
4. The strength (strong/moderate/weak based on evidence provided)

Argument:
{content}

Respond with a JSON array of causal links:
