# Steady Queue

Steady Queue is a database-backed task backend for Django 6.0+. It is a port to
Python of the excellent [Solid Queue](solid-queue-github) backend for Ruby on
Rails.

It is compatible with the [`django.tasks` interface](django-tasks-docs),
allowing you to manage background jobs using only your existing relational
database. By leveraging `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, Steady Queue provides a
high-performance, concurrency-safe queuing system without the operational
overhead of Redis or RabbitMQ.

## Core features

- **Task enqueueing and processing.** Using the standard `@task` decorator
  interface introduced in [DEP 0014](DEP0014) with support for queue selection,
  delayed tasks and numeric priorities.
- **No extra infrastructure.** Steady Queue can be used with SQL databases such
  as MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite, and it leverages the `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
  clause, if available, to avoid blocking and waiting on locks when polling
  tasks.
- **Cron-style recurring tasks.** Define schedules directly in your code using
  decorators.
- **Concurrency controls.** Limit how many instances of a specific task can run
  simultaneously.
- **Operational control and visibility**: pause and resume queues, inspect tasks
  and retry or discard failed ones directly from the Django admin interface.
- **A single dependency** on the crontab library to parse async task schedule
  definitions.

The database backend exposed by Steady Queue **doesn't support result fetching
or async task enqueueing**.

## Installation

1. **Install the `steady_queue` package,** e.g. run `pip install steady_queue`.
2. **Add `steady_queue` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`** in `settings.py`.
3. **Configure Steady Queue as a task backend.** In `settings.py`, add the
   Steady Queue backend:
   ```python
   TASKS = {
       "default": {
           "BACKEND": "steady_queue.backend.SteadyQueueBackend",
           "QUEUES": ["default"],
           "OPTIONS": {},
       }
   }
   ```
4. (Optional) [Configure a separate database for Steady
   Queue](#database-configuration) to avoid accidentally relying on
   transactional integrity.
5. **Migrate your database** with `python3 manage.py migrate` (or `python3
   manage.py migrate --database queue` if you configured a separate DB).


Now you're ready to start processing tasks by running `python manage.py
steady_queue` on the server that's doing the work. This will start processing
tasks in all queues using the default configuration. See below to learn more
about configuring Steady Queue.

For small projects, you can run Steady Queue on the same machine as your
webserver. When you're ready to scale, Steady Queue supports horizontal scaling
out-of-the-box. You can run Steady Queue on a separate server from your
webserver, or even run `python manage.py steady_queue` on multiple machines at
the same time. Depending on the configuration, you can designate some machines
to run only dispatchers or only workers. See the configuration section for more
details on this.

## Usage

Steady Queue works like any other DEP 0014-compatible task backend.

Tasks are functions decorated with the `@task` decorator from `django.tasks`:

```python
from django.tasks import task

@task()
def greet(name: str, times: int = 1):
    for _ in range(times):
        print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

To enqueue the task, call the `.enqueue()` method on it passing any arguments:

```python
greet.enqueue('World', 4)
```

### Configuring how tasks are run

The task decorator accepts these arguments to customize the task:

```python
@task(priority=10, queue_name='real_time', backend='steady_queue')
def tralalero():
    print('tralala')
```

- `priority` is an integer between -100 and 100 determining the importance of
  tasks within the same queue. The larger the value, the higher the priority.
  The default value is `0`.
- `queue_name` is the name of the queue where instances of this task will run.
  If not specified, it defaults to the `default` queue.
- `backend` is the key of the backend that will be used in the `TASKS`
  configuration in `settings.py`. If not specified, the `default` backend is
  selected.

These attributes can also be modified at runtime with `.using()`:

```python
tralalero.using(priority=-10, queue_name='low_importance').enqueue()
```

### Running tasks in the future

Steady Queue supports enqueueing tasks to be run at a later time via the
`run_after` parameter to `.using()`:

```python
greet.using(run_after=timezone.datetime(2030, 01, 01)).enqueue('World')
```

You can also pass a timedelta to be applied to the current time:

```python
greet.using(run_after=timezone.timedelta(minutes=1)).enqueue('hello')
```

### Argument serialization

Task functions can take almost any argument as either positional or keyword
arguments. Steady Queue improves on the serialization specified by DEP 0014 by
supporting timestamps, timedeltas and Django models. Django models are
serialized by storing the content type and object ID. If the model does not
exist on the database when the task is executed, a
`steady_queue.arguments.DeserializationError` is raised.

### Incremental adoption

If you're planning to adopt Steady Queue incrementally by switching one task at
a time, you can do so by setting the `backend` attribute on the `@task()`
decorator.

### High performance requirements

Steady Queue was designed for the highest throughput when used with MySQL 8+ or
PostgreSQL 9.5+, as they support `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. You can use it with
older versions, but in that case, you might run into lock waits if you run
multiple workers for the same queue. You can also use it with SQLite on smaller
applications.

## Configuration

### Workers, dispatchers and scheduler

We have several types of actors in Steady Queue:

- _Workers_ are in charge of picking tasks ready to run from queues and
  processing them. They work off the `steady_queue_ready_executions` table.
- _Dispatchers_ are in charge of selecting tasks scheduled to run in the future
  that are due and _dispatching_ them, which is simply moving them from the
  `steady_queue_scheduled_executions` table over to the
  `steady_queue_ready_executions` table so that workers can pick them up. On top
  of that, they do some maintenance work related to [concurrency
  controls](#concurrency-controls).
- The _scheduler_ manages [recurring tasks](#recurring-tasks), enqueuing tasks
  for them when they're due.
- The _supervisor_ runs workers and dispatchers according to the configuration,
  controls their heartbeats, and stops and starts them when needed.

Steady Queue's supervisor will fork a separate process for each supervised
worker/dispatcher/scheduler.

Steady Queue will try to find our configuration under the `STEADY_QUEUE`
variable in `settings.py`. Everything is optional. If no configuration is
provided, Steady Queue will run with one dispatcher and one worker per the
default settings:

```python
# settings.py
from steady_queue.configuration import Configuration
from datetime import timedelta

STEADY_QUEUE = Configuration.Options(
    dispatchers=[
        Configuration.Dispatcher(
            polling_interval=timedelta(seconds=1),
            batch_size=500
        )
    ],
    workers=[
        Configuration.Worker(
            queues=["*"],
            threads=3,
            polling_interval=timedelta(seconds=0.1)
        )
    ]
)
```

Everything is optional. If no configuration is provided at all, or no
configuration is given for workers or dispatchers, Steady Queue will run with
the defaults above.

Here's an overview of the different options:

- `polling_interval`: the time interval in seconds that workers and dispatchers
  will wait before checking for more tasks. This time defaults to `1` second for
  dispatchers and `0.1` seconds for workers.

- `batch_size`: the dispatcher will dispatch tasks in batches of this size. The
  default is 500.

- `concurrency_maintenance_interval`: the time interval in seconds that the
  dispatcher will wait before checking for blocked tasks that can be unblocked.
  Read more about [concurrency controls](#concurrency-controls) to learn more
  about this setting. It defaults to `600` seconds.

- `queues`: the list of queues that workers will pick tasks from. You can use
  `*` to indicate all queues (which is also the default and the behavior you'll
  get if you omit this). Tasks will be polled from those queues in order, so for
  example, with `['real_time', 'background']`, no tasks will be taken from
  `background` unless there aren't any more tasks waiting in `real_time`.

  You can also provide a prefix with a wildcard to match queues starting with a
  prefix. For example adding `staging*` to the queues list will create a worker
  fetching tasks from all queues starting with `staging`. The wildcard `*` is
  only allowed on its own or at the end of a queue name; you can't specify queue
  names such as `*_some_queue`. These will be ignored.

  Finally you can combine prefixes with exact names, like `['staging*',
  'background']`, and the behavior with respect to order will be the same as
  with only exact names.

  Check the sections below on [how queue order behaves combined with
  priorities](#queue-order-and-priorities), and [how the way you specify the
  queues per worker might affect
  performance](#queues-specification-and-performance).

- `threads`: this is the max size of the thread pool that each worker will have
  to run tasks. Each worker will fetch this number of tasks from their queue(s),
  at most and will post them to the thread pool to be run. By default, this is
  `3`. Only workers have this setting.

  It is recommended to set this value less than or equal to the queue database's
  connection pool size minus 2, as each worker thread uses one connection, and
  two additional connections are reserved for polling and heartbeat.

- `processes`: this is the number of worker processes that will be forked by the
  supervisor with the settings given. By default, this is `1`, just a single
  process. This setting is useful if you want to dedicate more than one CPU core
  to a queue or queues with the same configuration. Only workers have this
  setting.

- `concurrency_maintenance`: whether the dispatcher will perform the concurrency
  maintenance work. This is `true` by default, and it's useful if you don't use
  any [concurrency controls](#concurrency-controls) and want to disable it or if
  you run multiple dispatchers and want some of them to just dispatch tasks
  without doing anything else.

### Queue order and priorities

As mentioned above, if you specify a list of queues for a worker, these will be
polled in the order given, such as for the list `'real_time', 'background'`, no
tasks will be taken from `background` unless there aren't any more tasks waiting
in `real_time`.

Steady Queue supports numeric priorities between -100 and 100 when enqueuing
tasks, following Django's convention where larger numbers indicate higher
priority. The default is `0`.

This is useful when you run tasks with different importance or urgency in the
same queue. Within the same queue, tasks will be picked in order of priority
(higher numbers first), but in a list of queues, the queue order takes
precedence, so in the previous example with `real_time,background`, tasks in the
`real_time` queue will be picked before tasks in the `background` queue, even if
those in the `background` queue have a higher priority (larger value) set.

We recommend not mixing queue order with priorities but either choosing one or
the other, as that will make task execution order more straightforward for you.

### Queues specification and performance

To keep polling performant and ensure a covering index is always used, Steady
Queue only does two types of polling queries:

```sql
-- No filtering by queue
SELECT job_id
FROM steady_queue_ready_executions
ORDER BY priority DESC, job_id ASC
LIMIT ?
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED;

-- Filtering by a single queue
SELECT job_id
FROM steady_queue_ready_executions
WHERE queue_name = ?
ORDER BY priority DESC, job_id ASC
LIMIT ?
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED;
```

The first one (no filtering by queue) is used when you specify

```python
queues=['*']
```
and there aren't any queues paused, as we want to target all queues.

In other cases, we need to have a list of queues to filter by, in order, because
we can only filter by a single queue at a time to ensure we use an index to
sort. This means that if you specify your queues as:

```python
queues=['beta*']
```

we'll need to get a list of all existing queues matching that prefix first, with
a query that would look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(queue_name)
FROM steady_queue_ready_execution
WHERE queue_name LIKE 'beta%';
```

This type of `DISTINCT` query on a column that's the leftmost column in an index
can be performed very fast in MySQL thanks to a technique called [Loose Index
Scan](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-by-optimization.html#loose-index-scan).

PostgreSQL and SQLite, however, don't implement this technique, which means that
if your `steady_queue_ready_executions` table is very big because your queues
get very deep, this query will get slow. Normally your
`steady_queue_ready_executions` table will be small, but it can happen.

Similarly to using prefixes, the same will happen if you have paused queues,
because we need to get a list of all queues with a query like

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(queue_name)
FROM solid_queue_ready_execution
```

and then remove the paused ones. Pausing in general should be something rare,
used in special circumstances, and for a short period of time. If you don't want
to process tasks from a queue anymore, the best way to do that is to remove it
from your list of queues.

💡 To sum up, **if you want to ensure optimal performance on polling**, the best
way to do that is to always specify exact names for them, and not have any
queues paused.

Do this:

```python
queues=['background', 'backend']
```

instead of this:

```python
queues=['back*']
```

### Threads, processes and signals

Workers in Steady Queue use a thread pool to run work in multiple threads,
configurable via the `threads` parameter above. Besides this, parallelism can be
achieved via multiple processes on one machine (configurable via different
workers or the `processes` parameter above) or by horizontal scaling.

The supervisor is in charge of managing these processes, and it responds to the
following signals:

- `TERM`, `INT`: starts graceful termination. The supervisor will send a `TERM`
  signal to its supervised processes, and it'll wait up to
  `steady_queue.shutdown_timeout` time until they're done. If any supervised
  processes are still around by then, it'll send a `QUIT` signal to them to
  indicate they must exit.
- `QUIT`: starts immediate termination. The supervisor will send a `QUIT` signal
  to its supervised processes, causing them to exit immediately.

When receiving a `QUIT` signal, if workers still have tasks in-flight, these
will be returned to the queue when the processes are deregistered.

If processes have no chance of cleaning up before exiting (e.g. if someone pulls
a cable somewhere), in-flight tasks might remain claimed by the processes
executing them. Processes send heartbeats, and the supervisor checks and prunes
processes with expired heartbeats. Tasks that were claimed by processes with an
expired heartbeat will be marked as failed with a
`steady_queue.processes.ProcessPrunedError` exception. You can configure both
the frequency of heartbeats and the threshold to consider a process dead. See
the section below for this.

In a similar way, if a worker is terminated in any other way not initiated by
the above signals (e.g. a worker is sent a `KILL` signal), tasks in progress
will be marked as failed so that they can be inspected, with a
`steady_queue.processes.ProcessExitError` exception. Sometimes a task in
particular is responsible for this, for example, if it has a memory leak and you
have a mechanism to kill processes over a certain memory threshold, so this will
help identifying this kind of situation.

### Database configuration

To keep application data isolated from job storage (and avoid unintentionally
relying on transactional integrity), route `steady_queue` to its own database
alias.

1. Add a dedicated database entry in `DATABASES`:

```
DATABASES = {
    "default": {...},
    "queue": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        "NAME": "queue",
        "USER": "queue",
        "PASSWORD": "queue",
        "HOST": "localhost",
        "PORT": 5432,
        "TEST": {"NAME": "test_queue"},
    },
}
```

2. Tell Steady Queue which alias to use and register its database router:

```python
import steady_queue

steady_queue.database = "queue"
DATABASE_ROUTERS = ["steady_queue.db_router.SteadyQueueRouter"]
```

3. Run migrations against the Steady Queue database:

```
python manage.py migrate --database queue steady_queue
```

When running tests, Django will create test databases for both aliases using the
`TEST.NAME` values. This keeps job tables off your primary app database in
development and CI.

### Other configuration settings

*Note*: The settings in this section should be set directly on the
`steady_queue` module. You can do this on `settings.py` as well:

```python
import steady_queue

steady_queue.process_heartbeat_interval = timedelta(minutes=5)
```

There are several settings that control how Steady Queue works that you can set as well:

- `database`: the database alias that Steady Queue will use to store its
  tables—defaults to `"default"`. See the [database
  configuration](#database-configuration) section for more details.
- `process_heartbeat_interval`:  the heartbeat interval that all processes will
  follow—defaults to 60 seconds.
- `process_alive_threshold`: how long to wait until a process is considered dead
  after its last heartbeat—defaults to 5 minutes.
- `shutdown_timeout`: time the supervisor will wait since it sent the `TERM`
  signal to its supervised processes before sending a `QUIT` version to them
  requesting immediate termination—defaults to 5 seconds.
- `supervisor_pidfile`: path to a pidfile that the supervisor will create when
  booting to prevent running more than one supervisor in the same host, or in
  case you want to use it for a health check. It's set to
  `tmp/pids/steady_queue_supervisor.pid` by default.
- `preserve_finished_jobs`: whether to keep finished jobs in the
  `steady_queue_jobs` table—defaults to `True`.
- `clear_finished_jobs_after`: period to keep finished jobs around, in case
  `preserve_finished_jobs` is true—defaults to 1 day. **Note:** Right now,
  there's no automatic cleanup of finished jobs. You'd need to do this by
  periodically invoking `Job.objects.clear_finished_in_batches()`, which can be
  configured as [a recurring task](#recurring-tasks).
- `default_concurrency_control_period`: the value to be used as the default for
  the `duration` parameter in [concurrency controls](#concurrency-controls). It
  defaults to 3 minutes.

## Signals (Lifecycle hooks)

Steady Queue sends the following signals throughout the lifetime of a task:

- `django.tasks.signals.task_enqueued` when the task is first enqueued (and has
  been inserted into the database).
- `django.tasks.signals.task_started` when a worker starts executing the task
- `django.tasks.signals.task_finished` when task execution finishes or errors

All include the standard `sender` argument which is the `SolidQueueBackend`
instance that is handling the task, as well as the `task_result` (a
`django.tasks.TaskResult` instance) with information on how the task was called
and its status.

Unlike Solid Queue, steady queue doesn't yet emit signals related to the
lifecycle of its processes.

## Logging

Steady Queue uses the standard Python logging module to emit traces on the `steady_queue` logger.

## Concurrency controls

Steady Queue extends Django Tasks with concurrency controls, that allows you to
limit how many tasks of a certain type or with certain arguments can run at the
same time. When limited in this way, tasks will be blocked from running, and
they'll stay blocked until another task finishes and unblocks them, or after the
set expiry time (concurrency limit's _duration_) elapses. Tasks are never
discarded or lost, just blocked.


```python
from django.tasks import task

from steady_queue.concurrency import limits_concurrency

@limits_concurrency(
    key=lambda arg1, arg2, **kwargs: pass,
    to=max_concurrent_executions,
    duration=max_timedelta_to_guarantee_concurrency_limit,
    group=concurrency_group
)
@task()
def my_task(arg1, arg2, **kwargs):
    pass
```

- `key` is the only required parameter, and it can be a string or a callable
  that receives the same arguments as the task and returns a string. It will be
  used to identify the tasks that need to be limited together.
- `to` is `1` by default.
- `duration` is set to `steady_queue.default_concurrency_control_period` by
  default, which itself defaults to `3 minutes`.
- `group` is used to control the concurrency of different tasks types together.
  It defaults to the task's module path.

When a task includes these controls, we'll ensure that, at most, the number of
tasks (indicated as `to`) that yield the same `key` will be performed
concurrently, and this guarantee will last for `duration` for each task
enqueued. Note that there is no guarantee about _the order of execution_, only
about tasks being performed at the same time (overlapping).

The concurrency limits use the concept of semaphores when enqueueing, and work
as follows: when a task is enqueued, we check if it specifies concurrency
controls. If it does, we check the semaphore for the computed concurrency key.
If the semaphore is open, we claim it and we set the task as _ready_. Ready
means it can be picked up by workers for execution. When the task finishes
execution (be it successfully or unsuccessfully, resulting in a failed
execution), we signal the semaphore and try to unblock the next task with the
same key, if any. Unblocking the next task doesn't mean running that task right
away, but moving it from _blocked_ to _ready_. Since something can heppen that
prevents the first task from releasing the semaphore and unblocking the next
task (for example, someone pulling a plug in the machine where the worker is
running), we have the `duration` as a failsafe. Tasks that have been blocked for
more than duration are candidates to be released, but only as many of them as
the concurrency rules allow, as each one would need to go through the semaphore
dance check. This means that the `duration` is not really about the task that's
enqueued or being run, it's about the tasks that are blocked waiting. It's
important to note that after one or more candidate tasks are unblocked (either
because a task finishes or because `duration` expires and a semaphore is
released), the `duration` timer for the still blocked tasks is reset. This
happens indirectly via the expiration time of the semaphore, which is updated.

For example


```python
@limits_concurrency(
    to=2,
    key=lambda contact: contact.account_id,
    duration=timedelta(minutes=5)
)
@task()
def deliver_announcement(contact):
    pass
```

In this case, we'll ensure that at most two tasks of the kind
`deliver_announcement` for the same account will run concurrently. If, for any
reason, one of those tasks takes longer than 5 minutes or doesn't release its
concurrency lock (signals the semaphore) within 5 minutes of acquiring it, a new
task with the same key might gain the lock.

Let's see another example using `group`:

```python
@limits_concurrency(
    key=lambda contact: contact.pk,
    duration=timedelta(minutes=15),
    group='contact_tasks'
)
@task()
def contact_action(contact):
    pass
```


```python
@limits_concurrency(
    key=lambda bundle: bundle.contact_id,
    duration=timedelta(minutes=15),
    group='contact_tasks'
)
@task()
def bundle_action(bundle):
    pass
```

In this case, if we have a `contact_action` task enqueued for a contact record
with id `123` and another `bundle_action` task enqueued simultaneously for a
bundle record that references contact `123`, only one of them will be allowed to
proceed. The other one will stay blocked until the first one finishes (or 15
minutes pass, whatever happens first).

Note that the `duration` setting depends indirectly on the value for
`concurrency_maintenance_interval` that you set for your dispatcher(s), as
that'd be the frequency with which blocked tasks are checked and unblocked (at
which point, only one task per concurrency key, at most, is unblocked). In
general, you should set `duration` in a way that all your tasks would finish
well under that duration and think of the concurrency maintenance task as a
failsafe in case something goes wrong.

Tasks are unblocked in order of priority (higher numbers first) but queue order
is not taken into account for unblocking tasks. That means that if you have a
group of tasks that share a concurrency group but are in different queues, or
tasks of the same class that you enqueue in different queues, the queue order
you set for a worker is not taken into account when unblocking blocked ones. The
reason is that a task that runs unblocks the next one, and the task itself
doesn't know about a particular worker's queue order (you could even have
different workers with different queue orders), it can only know about priority.
Once blocked tasks are unblocked and available for polling, they'll be picked up
by a worker following its queue order.

Finally, failed tasks that are automatically or manually retried work in the
same way as new tasks that get enqueued: they get in the queue for getting an
open semaphore, and whenever they get it, they'll be run. It doesn't matter if
they had already gotten an open semaphore in the past.

## Tasks and transactional integrity

:warning: Having your tasks in the same ACID-compliant database as your
application data enables a powerful yet sharp tool: taking advantage of
transactional integrity to ensure some action in your app is not committed
unless your task is also committed and vice versa, and ensuring that your task
won't be enqueued until the transaction within which you're enqueuing it is
committed. This can be very powerful and useful, but it can also backfire if you
base some of your logic on this behavior, and in the future, you move to another
active task backend, or if you simply move Steady Queue to its own database, and
suddenly the behavior changes under you. Because this can be quite tricky and
many people shouldn't need to worry about it, we recommend [configuring Steady
Queue to run on a separate database](#database-configuration) from your main
app's.

An option which doesn't rely on transactional integrity is to defer the
enqueueing of a task inside a database transaction until that transaction
successfully commits. This can be achieved using the
[`transaction.on_commit`](transaction-on-commit) hook made available by Django:

```python
from django.db import transaction
from myapp.tasks import send_welcome_email
from functools import partial

def sign_up():
  user = User.objects.create('...')
  # ...

  transaction.on_commit(partial(send_welcome_email, user=user))
```

Notice how callbacks will not be passed any arguments, but you can bind them
with [`functools.partial`](functools-partial).

Using this option, you can also use Steady Queue in the same database as your
app but not rely on transactional integrity.

If you don't use this option but still want to make sure you're not
inadvertently relying on transactional integrity, you can make sure that:

- Your tasks relying on specific data are always enqueued on [`on_commit`
  callbacks](transaction-on-commit) or otherwise from a place where you're
  certain that whatever data the task will use has been committed to the
  database before the task is enqueued.
- Or, you configure a different database for Steady Queue, even if it's the same
  as your app, ensuring that a different connection on the thread handling
  requests or running tasks for your app wil be used to enqueue tasks.

## Recurring tasks

Steady Queue supports defining recurring tasks that run at specific times in the
future, on a regular basis like cron jobs. These are managed by the scheduler
process and are defined using the `@recurring` decorator:

```python
from steady_queue.recurring_task import recurring

@recurring(schedule="0 12 * * *", key="rot the brains at noon")
@task()
def ballerina():
    print('capuccina')
```

- The `schedule` parameter is a crontab string. Anything that is understood by
  the [crontab][contrab] library can be passed in here.
- The `key` parameter must be a unique identifier for this recurring
  configuration.
- Recurring tasks can also take arguments which can be configured together with
  the schedule via the `args` and `kwargs` parameters to `recurring`:

```python
@recurring(
    schedule="0 12 * * *",
    args=(10, 5),
    kwargs={'name': 'Sahur'},
    key="rot the brains at noon"
)
@task()
def countdown_greeting(from, to, name='Michael'):
    for i in range(from, to):
        print(i)

    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

This allows for running the same task on different schedules with different arguments:

```python
@recurring(schedule='0 10 * * *', args=('Alice',), key='greet_alice')
@recurring(schedule='0 12 * * *', args=('Bob',), key='greet_bob')
@task()
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

- `queue_name` allows specifying a different queue to be used when enqueueing
  the task. Otherwise, the queue passed to `@task()` or the default queue is
  used.
- `priority` is a numeric priority value used when enqueueing the task. If no
  priority is set on the recurring schedule, the priority passed to `@task()` or
  `0` is used instead.

Tasks are enqueued at their corresponding times by the scheduler, and each task schedules the next one.

It is possible to run multiple schedulers, for example, if you have multiple
servers for redundancy and your run the `scheduler` in more than one of them. To
avoid enqueueing duplicate tasks at the same time, an entry in the
`steady_queue_recurringexecution` table is added in the same transaction as the
task is enqueued. This table has a unique index on `task_key` and `run_at`,
ensuring only one entry per task per time will be created. This only works if
you have `preserve_finished_tasks` set to `True` (the default), and the
guarantee applies as long as you keep tasks around.


## Deviations from Solid Queue

The goal of this port has been to keep the internals as close as possible to a
direct translation from Ruby to Python, while adapting the external interfaces
to be idiomatic in Django. Code organization in classes and mixins, method
names, database field names and naming conventions are mostly untouched, but
there are a few differences which we outline below.

- The ORM is of course changed from Active Record to the Django ORM.
  - Class methods in Rails models generally become model manager methods under
    Django. Similarly, Active Record scopes are translated as queryset methods.
- ActiveJobs (the interface for background tasks in Ruby on Rails) are called
  tasks.
  - Since Steady Queue follows [DEP 0014][DEP0014] for its public API, tasks are
    decorated functions instead of classes.
  - Some features of ActiveJob, like dynamically setting queue names,
    priorities, concurrency keys, retry policies or exceptions to be caught are
    not available in SolidQueue due to the nature of the decorator-based
    approach to tasks. Users are encouraged to write their own decorators or
    otherwise make use of the `.using()` method of classes to configure these
    parameters dynamically where needed.
- Steady Queue provides dashboards that integrate with the Django admin site and
  are roughly equivalent to [mission_control-jobs][mission_control-jobs], but
  without requiring an external dependency.
- Command-based recurring tasks (i.e., those defined by passing code directly to
  the task schedule) are not supported in Steady Queue. Considering the ease
  with which a function can be scheduled as a periodic task, it is unlikely this
  will ever be supported, but we've kept the database column for compatibility.
- Steady Queue worker processes do not set the process name (or procline)
  because doing so requires introducing an external dependency.
- Steady Queue does not expose rich instrumentation like Solid Queue does due to
  the lack of a framework-native equivalent to `ActiveSupport::Notifications`.
- **Priority ordering:** Steady Queue follows Django's convention where larger
  numbers indicate higher priority (e.g., a task with priority 10 runs before
  priority 0), whereas Solid Queue uses the inverse (smaller numbers = higher
  priority). This aligns with [Django's task convention on priorities](django-task-priorities),
  where higher numbers have higher priority.
