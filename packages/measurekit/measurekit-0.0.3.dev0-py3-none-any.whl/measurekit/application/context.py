"""Manages the active unit system context for the MeasureKit library.

This module provides functions to get the currently active unit system and a
context manager to temporarily switch to a different system. This is crucial
for ensuring that quantity operations are performed within the correct set of
unit definitions, especially in applications that may need to work with
multiple, distinct unit systems simultaneously.
