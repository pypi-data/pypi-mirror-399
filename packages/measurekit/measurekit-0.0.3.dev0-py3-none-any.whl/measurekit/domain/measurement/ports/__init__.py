"""The MeasureKit Measurement Ports package.

The `ports` package defines the interfaces (Ports) for the measurement system,
following the principles of hexagonal architecture. These interfaces provide
a clear separation between the core logic of the measurement system and the
external tools and libraries that it interacts with. This design makes the
system more modular, extensible, and easier to maintain.
