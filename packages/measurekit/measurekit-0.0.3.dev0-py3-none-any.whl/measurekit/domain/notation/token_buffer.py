"""TokenBuffer module.

This module contains the TokenBuffer class, which is a class that provides a
way to look ahead in a token stream. It uses a deque to store the tokens and
provides a way to look ahead in the stream by indexing the buffer. It also
provides a way to advance the buffer by one token at a time, which is useful
for parsing.

The buffer is initially empty and is populated by the token stream as tokens
are requested. The buffer is only populated up to the point where the requested
token is, so if the token stream is infinite, the buffer will never contain
more than one token.
