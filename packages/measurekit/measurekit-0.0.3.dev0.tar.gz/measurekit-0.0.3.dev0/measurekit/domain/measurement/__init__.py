"""The MeasureKit Measurement package.

The `measurement` package is the core of the `measurekit` library, providing
the fundamental tools for representing and manipulating physical quantities.
It includes classes for handling units, dimensions, and uncertainties,
and provides a robust system for performing arithmetic operations and
conversions between different units. This package is the foundation upon
which the rest of the library is built.
