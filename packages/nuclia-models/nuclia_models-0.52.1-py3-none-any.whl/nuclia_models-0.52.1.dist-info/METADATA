## How to Use

To use one of the public models in your project, simply import it from the Nuclia SDK:

from nuclia_models.common.pagination import Pagination
from nuclia_models.events.activity_logs import ActivityLogsQuery, EventType

kb = sdk.NucliaKB()
query = ActivityLogsQuery(
    year_month="2024-10",
    show=["id", "date", "question", "answer"],
    filters={
        "question": {"ilike": "user question"},
        "feedback_good": {"eq": True}
    },
    pagination=Pagination(limit=10)
)
kb.logs.query(type=EventType.CHAT, query=query)
```
