# Git Worktree Integration Design

## Problem Statement

Running multiple `jc work` workflows in parallel creates dangerous conflicts:
- All workflows modify the same working directory
- Changes from one workflow break others mid-execution
- Circular imports and cascading failures
- No isolation between autonomous agents

**Example**: When workflow A adds `from module_b import X` and workflow B simultaneously refactors `module_b`, workflow A's tests fail unexpectedly.

## Solution: Git Worktrees for Workflow Isolation

Each workflow runs in its own **git worktree** with an isolated working directory and dedicated feature branch.

### Key Benefits

✅ **Complete Isolation** - Each workflow has its own working directory
✅ **Parallel Execution** - Run unlimited workflows simultaneously
✅ **No Cross-Contamination** - Changes in one workflow don't affect others
✅ **Clean Git History** - Each workflow on its own feature branch
✅ **Safe Testing** - Tests run independently per workflow
✅ **Transparent UX** - User doesn't need to know about worktrees

## Architecture Design

### 1. Worktree Lifecycle

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[jc work jean_claude-y97] --> B[Create worktree]
    B --> C[trees/beads-jean_claude-y97/]
    C --> D[Create branch beads/jean_claude-y97]
    D --> E[Run workflow in worktree]
    E --> F{Success?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Merge to main]
    F -->|No| H[Keep for debugging]
    G --> I[Delete worktree & branch]
    H --> J[Manual cleanup later]
```

### 2. Directory Structure

```
jean_claude/                    # Main repo (git root)
├── .git/                       # Shared git database
├── agents/                     # Workflow state (shared across worktrees)
│   ├── beads-jean_claude-y97/
│   │   ├── state.json         # Tracks worktree_path
│   │   └── logs/
│   └── beads-jean_claude-7gq/
│       └── state.json
├── trees/                      # Worktree directory (gitignored)
│   ├── beads-jean_claude-y97/ # Worktree for workflow y97
│   │   ├── src/               # Isolated copy of source
│   │   ├── tests/             # Isolated copy of tests
│   │   └── .git               # Worktree metadata (points to main .git)
│   └── beads-jean_claude-7gq/ # Worktree for workflow 7gq
│       └── src/
└── src/                        # Main working directory
    └── jean_claude/
```

### 3. Branch Naming Convention

Pattern: `beads/{task_id}`

Examples:
- `beads/jean_claude-y97` - Extract mailbox utilities
- `beads/jean_claude-7gq` - Add logging to hooks
- `beads/jean_claude-400` - Remove barrel exports

Benefits:
- Clear association with beads task
- Consistent namespace
- Easy to filter: `git branch | grep beads/`
- Follows git convention (type/identifier)

### 4. State Schema Updates

Add to `WorkflowState`:

```python
class WorkflowState(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...

    # Worktree tracking
    worktree_path: Path | None = None
    worktree_branch: str | None = None

    def get_project_root(self) -> Path:
        """Get the actual project root (worktree or main)."""
        return self.worktree_path or Path.cwd()
```

This allows workflows to track where they're executing and enables proper path resolution.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Worktree Management Module

### Phase 2: Integrate with `jc work` Command

Modify `src/jean_claude/cli/commands/work.py`:

```python
from jean_claude.integrations.worktree import (
    create_workflow_worktree,
    get_worktree_info,
    merge_workflow_to_main

        console.print(f"[yellow]Worktree preserved for debugging:[/yellow] {execution_root}")
        raise click.Abort()
```

### Phase 3: Integrate with `jc implement` Command

Modify `src/jean_claude/cli/commands/implement.py`:

```python
def implement(workflow_id: str, ...) -> None:
    """Resume implementing a workflow."""
    project_root = Path.cwd()

    # Load existing workflow state
    state = WorkflowState.load(workflow_id, project_root)

        execution_root = project_root
        console.print("[yellow]⚠ Legacy workflow (no worktree isolation)[/yellow]")

    # Continue workflow in appropriate context
    # ...
```

### Phase 4: Cleanup Commands

Add `src/jean_claude/cli/commands/worktrees.py`:

```python
"""Worktree management commands."""

import click
from rich.console import Console
from rich.table import Table

from jean_claude.integrations.worktree import (
    list_workflow_worktrees,

                    removed_count += 1
            except FileNotFoundError:

        console.print(f"[green]✓[/green] Cleaned up {removed_count} worktree(s)")
```

Register in `src/jean_claude/cli/main.py`:

```python
from jean_claude.cli.commands.worktrees import worktrees

cli.add_command(worktrees)
```

## Edge Cases and Solutions

### 1. Worktree Already Exists

**Scenario**: User runs `jc work jean_claude-y97` twice
**Solution**: Detect existing worktree, resume in it (don't recreate)

### 2. Branch Already Exists

**Scenario**: Previous workflow failed, branch left behind
**Solution**: Check branch state, prompt user to cleanup or force-recreate

### 3. Main Repo Has Uncommitted Changes

**Scenario**: User has WIP in main directory
**Solution**:
- Option A: Stash changes before creating worktree
- Option B: Require clean working directory
- **Recommended**: Option B (safer)

### 4. Merge Conflicts

**Scenario**: Two workflows modify the same file
**Solution**:
- Conflict detected during merge to main
- Keep worktree for manual resolution
- Provide clear instructions to user
- Mark workflow as "needs_merge"

### 5. Worktree Manually Deleted

**Scenario**: User deletes `trees/beads-jean_claude-y97/` directory
**Solution**: `jc implement` recreates it from branch

### 6. Process Crash Mid-Workflow

**Scenario**: System crash while workflow running
**Solution**: State saved in main repo survives, resume in worktree

### 7. Multiple Simultaneous Merges

**Scenario**: 3 workflows complete at once, all try to merge
**Solution**:
- Merges are sequential (git operations are atomic)
- Second merge waits for first to complete
- Lock file in .git/ prevents conflicts

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

1. `test_worktree_creation.py` - Create/remove operations
2. `test_worktree_info.py` - Query operations
3. `test_worktree_merge.py` - Merge logic
4. `test_worktree_edge_cases.py` - Error conditions

### Integration Tests

1. `test_work_command_worktree.py` - Full workflow in worktree
2. `test_parallel_workflows.py` - Multiple workflows simultaneously
3. `test_implement_resume.py` - Resume in existing worktree
4. `test_merge_workflow.py` - Successful merge to main
5. `test_merge_conflicts.py` - Conflict handling

### Manual Testing

1. Run 3 workflows in parallel - verify isolation
2. Crash workflow mid-execution - verify resume works
3. Create merge conflict - verify conflict handling
4. Clean up stale worktrees - verify cleanup command

---

## Performance Considerations

### Disk Space

- Each worktree is a full copy of the working directory
- Typical jean_claude repo: ~50MB per worktree
- 10 parallel workflows = 500MB
- **Solution**: Automatic cleanup of completed workflows

### Creation Speed

- Git worktree creation: ~100ms
- Negligible overhead compared to workflow duration (minutes)

### Git Operations

- All worktrees share same `.git/` database
- Objects are shared (no duplication)
- Only working files are duplicated

---

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility

Support both modes during transition:

```python
# In WorkflowState
def get_project_root(self) -> Path:
    """Get project root (worktree if available, else main)."""
    if self.worktree_path and self.worktree_path.exists():
        return self.worktree_path
    return Path.cwd()
```

### Rollout Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Implement worktree module, add tests
2. **Phase 2**: Make worktrees optional (flag: `--use-worktree`)
3. **Phase 3**: Enable by default with opt-out (`--no-worktree`)
4. **Phase 4**: Remove opt-out, always use worktrees

---

## User Experience

### Transparent Mode (Recommended)

User runs familiar commands, worktrees are automatic:

```bash
# User doesn't think about worktrees
$ jc work jean_claude-y97 --auto-confirm
Creating isolated worktree...
✓ Worktree created: trees/beads-jean_claude-y97
Branch: beads/jean_claude-y97

# ... workflow runs ...

✓ All features completed!
Merging changes to main...
✓ Changes merged and worktree cleaned up
```

### Advanced Mode

Power users can inspect/manage worktrees:

```bash
# List active worktrees
$ jc worktrees list

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Create `worktree.py` module with all functions
- [ ] Add worktree fields to `WorkflowState`
- [ ] Modify `work.py` to create worktrees
- [ ] Modify `implement.py` to resume in worktrees
- [ ] Add `worktrees` CLI command group
- [ ] Write unit tests for worktree operations
- [ ] Write integration tests for parallel workflows
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Test migration from legacy (no worktree) workflows
- [ ] Add logging for all worktree operations
- [ ] Handle merge conflicts gracefully
- [ ] Implement automatic cleanup of completed workflows

## Open Questions

1. **Should we auto-pull main before creating worktree?**
   - Pro: Ensures worktree starts from latest main
   - Con: Slows down workflow start
   - **Recommendation**: Yes, always start from latest main

2. **Should we auto-push feature branches?**
   - Pro: Backup in case of local failure
   - Con: Clutters remote with many branches
   - **Recommendation**: No, branches are local only

3. **How to handle very old stale worktrees?**
   - Add `last_accessed` timestamp
   - Auto-cleanup worktrees older than 7 days?
   - **Recommendation**: Manual cleanup only (user decides)

4. **Should agents/ directory be in main repo or worktree?**
   - **Main repo**: State persists across worktree deletion
   - **Worktree**: State isolated per workflow
   - **Recommendation**: Main repo (more robust)

## Conclusion

Git worktrees provide **perfect isolation** for parallel workflow execution while maintaining a clean, understandable git history. The implementation is straightforward, the UX remains transparent, and the benefits are immediate.

This solves the parallel execution problem completely and enables safe autonomous workflow orchestration at scale.
