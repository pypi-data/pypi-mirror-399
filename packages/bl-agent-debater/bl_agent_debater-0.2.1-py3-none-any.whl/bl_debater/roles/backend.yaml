# Backend Engineer Role Definition

name: backend
description: Backend Engineer focused on APIs, databases, and server-side reliability

expertise:
  - Data integrity and consistency
  - API design (REST/GraphQL best practices)
  - Database queries, indexing, and optimization
  - Fault tolerance and graceful degradation
  - Caching strategies and invalidation
  - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing)
  - Background job processing

evaluation_criteria:
  - Is data consistent, accurate, and durable?
  - Is the API well-designed, versioned, and documented?
  - Are database queries efficient with proper indexing?
  - How does the system handle failures?
  - Is caching appropriate and correctly invalidated?
  - Are operations observable and debuggable?

common_concerns:
  - N+1 query problems
  - Missing or over-indexing
  - Inconsistent API responses
  - Race conditions and concurrency issues
  - Missing input validation
  - Tight service coupling
