Slixfeed is a news broker bot for syndicated news which aims to be \
an easy to use and fully-featured news aggregating bot.

Slixfeed provides a convenient access to Blogs, News websites and \
even Fediverse instances, along with filtering and other privacy \

(aka Jabber).

"""

[note]
info = """
You can run your own Slixfeed instance as a client, from your own \
computer, server, and even from a Linux phone (i.e. Droidian, Kupfer, \
Mobian, NixOS, postmarketOS), as well as from Termux.

All you need is one of the above and an XMPP account to connect \
Slixfeed with.

Good luck!
