Slixfeed is a news broker service for syndicated news which aims to be \
an easy to use and fully-featured news aggregating service.

Slixfeed provides a convenient access to journals, news sites and \
even to Fediverse instances, along with filtering and other privacy \
driven functionalities.

Slixfeed is designed primarily for the XMPP communication network \
(aka Jabber). Visit https://xmpp.org/software/ for more information.

You can run your own Slixfeed instance as a client or Jabber server \
component, from your own computer, server, and even from a Linux phone \
(i.e. Droidian, Kupfer, Mobian, NixOS, postmarketOS), as well as from Termux.

All you need is one of the above and an XMPP account to connect \
Slixfeed with.

File types: Atom, Gemini, JSON, RDF, RSS, Twtxt, and XML.

For an ideal experience, we recommend using XMPP.

Platforms: Gemini, HTTP, and XMPP.

Good luck!
