Python port of the R package [artpack](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=artpack), bringing generative art color palettes to the Python ecosystem.

## About

artpack provides curated color palettes designed for generative art and data visualization. This is a work-in-progress port of the original R package.

## Installation

```bash
pip install artpack-py
```

## Quick Start

```python
from artpack import art_pals

# Get 5 colors from the ocean palette
colors = art_pals("ocean", n=5)
print(colors)
# ['#12012E', '#144267', '#15698C', '#0695AA', '#156275']

# Reverse the palette
colors_rev = art_pals("ocean", n=5, direction = "reverse")

# Randomize color order
colors_random = art_pals("rainbow", n = 10, randomize = True)
```

## Available Palettes

`"arctic"`, `"beach"`, `"bw"`, `"brood"`, `"cosmos"`, `"explorer"`, `"gemstones"`, `"grays"`, `"icecream"`, `"imagination"`, `"majestic"`, `"nature"`, `"neon"`, `"ocean"`, `"plants"`, `"rainbow"`, `"sunnyside"`, `"super"`

## Development Status

🚧 **Work in Progress** - Currently porting core functionality from the R version. More features coming soon!

**Currently implemented:**
- ✅ Color palette generation (`art_pals()`)
- ✅ Circle data generation (`circle_data()`)
- ✅ 100% test coverage
- ✅ CI/CD with GitHub Actions

**Roadmap:**
- Additional color palette tools (Functions that help with color-related tasks.)
- Asset creation (Functions that help with making data for generative art.)
- Geometric testing tools (Functions that help with geometric/spatial analysis for generative art.)
- Grouping tools (Functions that help with grouping generative art data.)
- Sequencing tools (Functions that help with numeric sequencing.)
- Transformation tools (Functions that help with transforming existing generative art data.)
