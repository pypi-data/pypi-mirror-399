"""
Common models package.

This package provides reusable mixins and base models for Django applications.
It's organized into logical modules for better maintainability and easier imports.

Modules:
    base: Core mixins (UserActionMixin, TimeStampMixin, SoftDeleteMixin, BaseModelMixin)
    content: Content-related mixins (SlugMixin, MetaMixin, VersionMixin)
    person: Person-related mixins and models (IdentityMixin, AddressMixin, PersonMixin)

Usage:
    from drf_commons.models import BaseModelMixin, PersonMixin
    from drf_commons.models import UserActionMixin, TimeStampMixin
    from drf_commons.models import IdentityMixin, AddressMixin
    from drf_commons.models import SlugMixin, MetaMixin, VersionMixin
