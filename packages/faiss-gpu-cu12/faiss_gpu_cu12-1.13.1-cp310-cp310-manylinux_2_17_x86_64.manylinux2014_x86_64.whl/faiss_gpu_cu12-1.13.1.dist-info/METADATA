# faiss-wheels

This repository is based on [kyamagu/faiss-wheels](https://github.com/kyamagu/faiss-wheels).

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/faiss-gpu-cu11?label=faiss-gpu-cu11)](https://pypi.org/project/faiss-gpu-cu11/)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/faiss-gpu-cu12?label=faiss-gpu-cu12)](https://pypi.org/project/faiss-gpu-cu12/)

## Overview

This repository provides scripts to build GPU-enabled wheels for the [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) library.
Distributes `faiss-gpu-cuXX` packages to PyPI using the contents of this repository.

### Key Features

* **No local CUDA installation required** - Dynamically links to CUDA Runtime and cuBLAS libraries from PyPI
* Builds CUDA 11.8+ and CUDA 12.1+ compatible wheels
* Supports Volta to Ada Lovelace architecture GPUs (Compute Capability 7.0–8.9)
* Bundles OpenBLAS in Linux
* Reduces wheel file size through dynamic linking instead of static compilation

## Important Requirements

The published `faiss-gpu-cuXX` packages require proper system setup that cannot be managed by pip. It is your responsibility to prepare a suitable environment:

1. **NVIDIA Driver**: Your host must have a CUDA-compatible NVIDIA driver installed
   * The minimum driver version depends on the CUDA version that gets installed
   * NVIDIA drivers are backward compatible with older CUDA versions ([See CUDA Compatibility Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/))

2. **GPU Architecture**: Your GPU must be compatible (Compute Capability 7.0–8.9)
   * Supported: Volta, Turing, Ampere, Ada Lovelace

3. **Library Compatibility**: If you install multiple CUDA-dependent libraries (e.g., PyTorch) in the same environment, they must link to the same CUDA version

## GPU Architecture Support for PyPI Packages

### Support Policy for `faiss-gpu-cu11` and `faiss-gpu-cu12`

**Note**: This is an **unofficial, personal development project** with limited computational resources. Due to these constraints, comprehensive testing across all NVIDIA GPU architectures is not feasible. The pre-built `faiss-gpu-cu11` and `faiss-gpu-cu12` packages on PyPI aim to support the same GPU architecture range (Compute Capability 7.0–8.9) as the official Faiss repository.

### For Unsupported GPU Architectures

If you have a GPU architecture that is not supported by these pre-built wheels:

1. **Official Faiss**: Follow the [official Faiss repository build instructions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/blob/main/INSTALL.md)
2. **Build from Source**: Use this repository's code to build wheels for your specific architecture (see [Building from Source](#building-from-source) section)

## Installation

The `faiss-gpu-cu11` and `faiss-gpu-cu12` wheels are available on PyPI. Choose the appropriate version for your CUDA environment.

### For CUDA 12

```bash
# Install with fixed CUDA 12.1 (requires NVIDIA Driver ≥R530)
pip install 'faiss-gpu-cu12[fix-cuda]'

# Install with CUDA 12.X (X≥1) - allows flexibility but driver requirement varies
pip install faiss-gpu-cu12
```

**Details:**

* `faiss-gpu-cu12` is built with CUDA Toolkit 12.1 and maintains minor version compatibility
* With `[fix-cuda]`: Installs exactly CUDA 12.1, requiring NVIDIA Driver ≥R530
* Without `[fix-cuda]`: Allows any CUDA 12.X (X≥1), driver requirement depends on the actual CUDA version installed
  * For example: CUDA 12.4 requires Driver ≥R550
* Use without `[fix-cuda]` when integrating with other CUDA-dependent packages (e.g., PyTorch with CUDA 12.4)

**System Requirements:**

* OS: Linux x86_64 (glibc ≥2.17)
* GPU: Compute Capability 7.0–8.9

### For CUDA 11

```bash
# Install with CUDA 11.8 (requires NVIDIA Driver ≥R520)
pip install faiss-gpu-cu11[fix-cuda]

# Same as above (CUDA 11.8 is the final version)
pip install faiss-gpu-cu11
```

**Details:**

* `faiss-gpu-cu11` is built with CUDA Toolkit 11.8
* Both commands install CUDA 11.8 since no newer CUDA 11.X versions exist
* Requires NVIDIA Driver ≥R520

**System Requirements:**

* OS: Linux x86_64 (glibc ≥2.17)
* GPU: Compute Capability 7.0–8.9

### Driver Compatibility Reference

| CUDA Version | Minimum Driver Version |
|--------------|------------------------|
| CUDA 11.8    | ≥R520 (520.61.05)      |
| CUDA 12.1    | ≥R530 (530.30.02)      |
| CUDA 12.2+   | Check [NVIDIA Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/) |

**Warning**: When installing without `[fix-cuda]`, pip may resolve to a newer CUDA version that requires a newer driver than you have installed. Always verify driver compatibility before installation.

### Advanced: Using System CUDA Libraries

If you need to use system-installed CUDA instead of PyPI CUDA packages, you can bypass the automatic CUDA loading:

1. **Exclude PyPI CUDA dependencies** using your package manager (e.g., [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7214), [pdm](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/usage/config/#exclude-specific-packages-and-their-dependencies-from-the-lock-file))
2. **Set environment variable**: `_FAISS_WHEEL_DISABLE_CUDA_PRELOAD=1`
3. **Ensure CUDA libraries are accessible** via `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

Example with uv (workaround):

```toml
# In pyproject.toml
[tool.uv]
override-dependencies = [
    "nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu11==0.0.0; sys_platform == 'never'",
    "nvidia-cublas-cu11==0.0.0; sys_platform == 'never'",
]
```

## Versioning

* Follows the original faiss repository versioning (e.g., `1.11.0`)
* Patches specific to this repository use `postN` suffix (e.g., `1.11.0.post1`)

## Building from Source

Build `faiss-gpu-cu11` and `faiss-gpu-cu12` wheels using [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel).

### Build Configuration

```bash
# Configure build parameters
export NJOB="32"                          # Number of parallel build jobs
export FAISS_OPT_LEVEL="generic"          # Options: generic, avx2, avx512
export CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="70-real;80-real"  # Target GPU architectures

# For builds without GPU testing
export CIBW_TEST_COMMAND_LINUX=""

# For builds with GPU testing (requires NVIDIA Docker)
export CIBW_CONTAINER_ENGINE='docker; create_args: --gpus all'
# Note: GPU testing requires Docker with NVIDIA Container Toolkit configured
```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build faiss-gpu-cu11 wheels
uvx cibuildwheel@2.23.2 variant/gpu-cu11 --output-dir wheelhouse/gpu-cu11

# Build faiss-gpu-cu12 wheels
uvx cibuildwheel@2.23.2 variant/gpu-cu12 --output-dir wheelhouse/gpu-cu12
```

Wheels will be created in `{repository_root}/wheelhouse/gpu-cuXX/`.

### Build Requirements

* OS: Linux x86_64
* NVIDIA Container Toolkit (if running tests)
* NVIDIA Driver: ≥R530 (if running tests with CUDA 12)
