# Security Policy

Security is very important to the FastGram project and its community. 🔒

Learn more about it below. 👇

## Versions

The latest version of FastGram is supported.

It is recommended that you write tests for your application and frequently update your FastGram version after ensuring your tests pass successfully. This way, you will be able to benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and **security fixes.**

You can learn more about FastGram versions and how to pin and update them for your project in the documentation.

## Vulnerability Disclosure

If you find a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it immediately by sending an email to: n7for8572@gmail.com. Try to be as detailed as possible, describing all steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

I (the author, [@neforceo](https://x.com/neforceo)) will carefully review your report and get back to you.

## Public Discussions

Please refrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability. 🙊

It is better to discuss it privately and try to find a resolution first to minimize the potential impact as much as possible.
