📱 AI Chat Web Application 🤖

This project is a free application designed for easy integration into your services.

Core Endpoints:
    - /v1/ : The project root. Returns your network identification.
      └ Accepts no parameters. Returns your current public IP address.
      └ Returns your local IP address if the application is running on localhost for testing.

    - /v1/chat/create : The main chat generation endpoint.
      └ Uses a predefined enumeration class for AI models (no manual string entry required).
      └ Simply select a model from the list, enter your prompt, and you're all set! ✅
      └ Note: This is the initial version (v1), and more features will be added in future updates.

Enjoy using the app! 🥰
