def gpt_app() -> FastAPI:
    """
Creates and configures a FastAPI application instance.

Initializes the application with global settings (title, version,
description), attaches the lifespan event handler, and registers
the core routes.

The application is highly scalable and provides baseline GPT-related
functionality. You can easily extend it by attaching your own
endpoints as shown in the example below.

Returns:
    FastAPI: The configured application instance.

Example:
    ```python
    from fastapi_helper.pj import gpt_app
    from fastapi import APIRouter

    router = APIRouter()

    @router.get('/')
    async def index_app() -> dict[str, bool]:
        return {"ok": True}

    main_app = gpt_app()
    main_app.include_router(router=router)
    ```
"""

    app = FastAPI(
        title=app_settings.title,
        version=app_settings.version,
        description=app_settings.description,
        lifespan=lifespan
    )

    app.include_router(router)
    return app
