        So we had a class:
        ```python
        from fastapi_helper.sql import ORMBase

        async def init_db():
        async with ...:
            await conn.run_sync(ORMBase.metadata.create_all)
        ```
        and with an initialization of the database,
        it will create all the tables in the database, giving them their names
        and lowering them into a lower register and adding an "s" letter automatically.

        And on the output we will get 
        a table with a name "users"

        :rtype: str
