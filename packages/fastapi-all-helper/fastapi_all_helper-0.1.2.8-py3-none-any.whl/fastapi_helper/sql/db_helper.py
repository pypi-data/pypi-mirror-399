    Docstring for DataBaseHelper

    DataBaseHelper is the main library class, and in this class such methods are implemented:
    - Creating async engine

    - Creating a session factory

    - Method(init_db) for database initialization

    - Method(dispose) for closing open connections with a database
      when your app is shut down

    - Method(session_getter) which opens connection with a database by request
      and temporarily gives a session for work, and with a shutdown
      closes connection automatically.

    And you do not need to do this all manually - its already done for you!
    All you need is to create DataBaseHelper class object and in "url" put
    a link to your database.
