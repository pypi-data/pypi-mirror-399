# Backend library for DCore


This library includes Python files originating from the following TRIQS libraries.

* TRIQS https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs.git
* TRIQS/DFTTools https://github.com/TRIQS/dft_tools.git
* TRIQS/h5 https://github.com/TRIQS/h5.git
* TRIQS/mpi https://github.com/TRIQS/mpi.git

`dcorelib`, which depends only on standard scientific Python libraries such as numpy,
 is intended to provide a subset of the functionalities of these libraries.
When you publish a scientific paper on results obtained by using `dcorelib`,
we kindly ask you to cite software papers on these TRIQS libraries.
