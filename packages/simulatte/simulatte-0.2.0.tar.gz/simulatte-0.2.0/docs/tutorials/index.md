# Tutorials

Small, copy/paste-friendly walkthroughs.

- [Job-shop basics](job-shop-basics.md): build a tiny shop, run jobs through multiple servers, read metrics.
- [Release control](release-control.md): pre-shop pool, release policies, and composable triggers.
- [ShopFloor extensibility](shopfloor-extensibility.md): add hooks, swap WIP strategies, customize metrics.
- [Multi-run experiments](multi-run-experiments.md): repeat runs across random seeds with `Runner`.
- [Logging](logging.md): trace events, debug behavior, and analyze simulation history.
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md): common gotchas and how to fix them.

## Experimental

Experimental APIs live under `simulatte.experimental` and may change between releases.

- [Materials, warehouse, and AGVs](../experimental/materials-warehouse-agvs.md): add inventory + transport with FIFO blocking semantics.
