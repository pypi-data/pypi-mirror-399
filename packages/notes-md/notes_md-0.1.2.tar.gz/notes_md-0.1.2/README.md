# :notebook: notes-md

A lightweight CLI for managing Markdown notes per project, backed by Git.

Each directory you work in gets its own notes folder, stored in a centralized
location(`$HOME/notes` by default) and synced with Git. Notes are opened in your `$EDITOR` and designed to
stay out of your working directory.

## Installation
### PyPI
```bash
pip install notes-md
```

### Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/viacoffee/notes-md.git
cd notes-md
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start
```bash
notes-md init
notes-md add my_awesome_notes
notes-md sync
```

## Configuration
On first run, `notes-md` creates a config file in your home directory:
```yaml
# $HOME/.config/notes-md/config.yaml

notes_dir: ~/notes
```
This directory will contain one subdirectory per _project_. _Projects_ are created on `notes-md init` and use the current working directory as the project name.

### Editor
notes-md uses `$EDITOR` (falls back to `nano`)

### Git
For syncing, the `$HOME/notes` directory should be a git repo. `notes-md sync` triggers a commit and push to that repo.
