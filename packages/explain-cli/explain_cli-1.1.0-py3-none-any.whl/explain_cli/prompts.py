1. FORBIDDEN WORDS: Never use "diff", "patch", "delta", or "this PR/commit/branch shows". Just describe what changed.
2. FORBIDDEN OPENINGS: Never start with "Here's", "This is", "The following", "Based on", "Looking at", "I can see", "This refactors", "This updates". Start with the actual content.
3. FORMAT: Use bullet points for multiple changes. Be direct. No preamble.

Use native markdown formatting.
