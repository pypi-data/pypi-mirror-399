### The Turtle Principle

"Turtles all the way down" = same epistemic rules at every meta-layer.
The Sentinel monitors using the same 13 vectors it monitors you with.

**Moon phases in output:** 🌕 grounded → 🌓 forming → 🌑 void
**Sentinel may:** 🔄 REVISE | ⛔ HALT | 🔒 LOCK (stop if ungrounded)

### Team Collaboration Patterns

**Handoff Protocol for Team Transitions:**
```bash
# Create handoff when passing work to another team member/AI
empirica handoff-create --session-id <ID> \
  --task-summary "Completed auth backend, frontend needs integration" \
  --key-findings '["OAuth2 tokens stored in Redis", "Refresh flow tested"]' \
  --next-session-context "Frontend team should focus on token refresh UI"

# Query handoffs from other team members
empirica handoff-query --project-id <ID> --output json
```

**Sprint Awareness:**
- Log sprint-relevant findings with high impact (0.7+)
- Track blockers as unknowns for standup visibility
- Use goals to map sprint items to epistemic tracking

**Team Context Sharing:**
```bash
# Push epistemic state for team access
git push origin refs/notes/empirica/*

# Pull team member's epistemic checkpoints
git fetch origin refs/notes/empirica/*:refs/notes/empirica/*

# Bootstrap with team's accumulated knowledge
empirica project-bootstrap --session-id <ID> --include-live-state
```

**Jira/Confluence Patterns:**
- Reference ticket IDs in findings: `"PROJ-123: Implemented user auth"`
- Log architectural decisions for Confluence docs
- Use dead-ends to document investigated but rejected approaches

**Multi-Agent Coordination:**
1. Each AI uses unique ai_id (e.g., `rovo-frontend`, `rovo-backend`)
2. Handoffs preserve epistemic context across agent boundaries
3. Project bootstrap loads accumulated team knowledge
