description: Comprehensive semantic index for AI-first bootstrap. Organized by epistemic
  tiers. Bootstrap loads dynamically based on uncertainty level, project scope, and
  multi-AI coordination needs.
tier_definitions:
  tier1: Core epistemic (vectors, workflow, theory)
  tier2: Execution context (APIs, patterns, investigation)
  tier3: Project/session structure (switching, handoffs, storage)
  tier4: Integration & coordination (BEADS, MCP, multi-AI)
  tier5: System-level (architecture, internals, debugging)
  tier6: Reference knowledge (overviews, definitions, history)
  tier7: Optional context-specific (setup, installation, design rationale)
