# Empirica Semantic Documentation Index
# Version: 2.0
# Generated: 2025-12-18
# Purpose: Enable fast semantic documentation discovery for project-bootstrap
# Note: This indexes EMPIRICA'S documentation (for dogfooding). Other projects
#       create their own SEMANTIC_INDEX.yaml to index THEIR project docs.

coverage:

  getting_started: 3

# ============================================================================
# USAGE EXAMPLES
# ============================================================================
#
# Query by tag:
#   docs = query_by_tag("core-concept")  → Returns top 5 priority docs
#   docs = query_by_tag("installation")  → Returns installation guides
#
# Query by question:
#   docs = query_by_question("What is Empirica?") → Returns 01_START_HERE.md
#   docs = query_by_question("How to install?") → Returns 04_INSTALLATION.md
#
# Query by use case:
#   docs = query_by_use_case("onboarding") → Returns START_HERE, INSTALLATION
#   docs = query_by_use_case("architecture-understanding") → Returns architecture docs
#
# Project Bootstrap Loading:
#   When running: empirica project-bootstrap --project-id <ID>
#   Automatically loads top 5 docs (prioritizes "core-concept" tagged ones)
#   Result: Fast context loading (~800 tokens) with most relevant docs

# ============================================================================
# NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS
# ============================================================================
#
# This semantic index is for EMPIRICA'S OWN DOCUMENTATION (dogfooding).
#
# Other projects using Empirica should create their own SEMANTIC_INDEX.yaml
# in their docs/ directory to index THEIR project's documentation.
#
# Example for a game project:
#   docs/SEMANTIC_INDEX.yaml would index:
#   - game-design.md
#   - api-reference.md
#   - architecture-decisions.md
#   - etc.
#
# The project-bootstrap command loads from: {project_root}/docs/SEMANTIC_INDEX.yaml
