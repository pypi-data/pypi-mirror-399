# 💻🎤🔊 localtalk

A privacy-first voice assistant that runs entirely offline on Apple Silicon, perfect for travelers, privacy-conscious users, and anyone who values their data sovereignty. No accounts, no cloud services, no tracking - just powerful AI that respects your privacy.

Currently, this library needs immediate work in the following areas before I can recommend usage.

- Develop a "System Prompt" with various personas
- Augment with local system knowledge (date/time, username, etc)

Plenty of alternative projects exist, but `localtalk` aims for the best one liner onboarding experience, and prioritizes direct usage rather than acting as a `import`able library for other wrappers. It also has no agenda to upgrade you to a SaaS SDK or service.

## Why This Project Exists

1. **Technology preview** - While the tech isn't perfect yet, we can build something functional right now that respects your privacy and runs entirely offline.

2. **As a vibe check on offline-first AI** - How realistic is it to avoid cloud services like OpenAI and ElevenLabs? This project explores what's possible with local models and helps identify the gaps.

3. **Future-proofing for real-time local AI** - One day soon, these models and consumer computers will be capable of real-time TTS that rivals cloud services. When that day comes, this library will be ready to leverage those improvements immediately.

### Why Not Use Apple's Built-in "Say" Command?

We deliberately chose not to use macOS's built-in `say` command for text-to-speech. While it's readily available and requires no setup, the voice quality is too robotic to meet today's user expectations. After being exposed to natural-sounding AI voices from services like ElevenLabs and OpenAI, users expect conversational AI to sound human-like. The `say` command's 1990s-era voice synthesis would make the assistant feel outdated and diminish the user experience, so it wasn't worth implementing as an option.

Apple's newer [Speech Synthesis API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/speech-synthesis) offers much higher quality voices that could be a great fit for this project. However, we're waiting for proper Python library support to integrate it. Once Python bindings become available, we'll add support for these modern Apple voices as another local TTS option.

Built with speech recognition (Whisper), language model processing (Gemma3/MLX), and text-to-speech synthesis (ChatterBox Turbo), LocalTalk gives you the convenience of modern AI assistants without sacrificing your privacy or requiring internet connectivity.

## Why "LocalTalk"?

The name "LocalTalk" is a playful homage to [Apple's classic LocalTalk networking protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LocalTalk) from the 1980s. Just as the original LocalTalk enabled local network communication between Apple devices without needing external infrastructure, our LocalTalk enables local AI conversations without needing external cloud services.

The name works on two levels:

- **Local**: Everything runs locally on your Mac - no internet required after initial setup
- **Talk**: It's literally a talking app that listens and responds with voice

It's the perfect name for an offline voice assistant that embodies Apple's tradition of making powerful technology accessible and self-contained.

## Quick Start (Hello World)

### Basic Usage

Run the voice assistant with default settings:

```bash
localtalk
```

This will:

1. Start with ChatterBox Turbo TTS
2. Use the `mlx-community/gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4-Q8` model
3. Enable dual-modal input (type or speak)
4. Use `base.en` Whisper model for speech recognition
5. Enable Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for automatic speech detection

### Complete Hello World Example

```bash
# 1. Run the voice assistant
localtalk

# 2. You'll see: "💬 Type your message or press Enter for auto-listening (VAD will detect speech):"
# 3. Either:
#    - Type "Hello, how are you?" and press Enter
#    - OR press Enter and start speaking (VAD will automatically detect when you start and stop)
# 4. Listen to the AI's response with ChatterBox Turbo TTS!
```

### Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Modes

LocalTalk now includes Silero VAD for intelligent speech detection:

```bash
# Default: Auto-listening mode (press Enter, then speak - VAD detects start/stop)
localtalk

# Manual VAD mode (press Enter to start, VAD detects when you stop)
localtalk --vad-manual

# Disable VAD (classic mode: press Enter to start, press Enter to stop)
localtalk --no-vad

# Adjust VAD sensitivity (0.0-1.0, default: 0.5)
localtalk --vad-threshold 0.3  # More sensitive
localtalk --vad-threshold 0.7  # Less sensitive
```

### TTS Configuration

```bash
# Default: ChatterBox Turbo TTS
localtalk

# Disable TTS for text-only mode
localtalk --no-tts
```

### Disabling Progress Bars

If you prefer to disable progress bar output during model loading, set the environment variable:

```bash
export TQDM_DISABLE=1
localtalk
```

config.mlx_lm.model = "mlx-community/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-4bit"

# Create and run assistant
assistant = VoiceAssistant(config)
assistant.run()
```

### Custom System Prompts

```bash
localtalk --system-prompt "You are a pirate. Respond in pirate speak, matey!"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Model not found" error**:
   - The model will be automatically downloaded on first use
   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection for the initial download
   - Check that you have sufficient disk space (~4-8GB per model)

2. **"No microphone found" error**:
   - Check your system's audio permissions
   - Ensure your microphone is properly connected
   - Try specifying a different audio device

3. **"Out of memory" error**:
   - MLX is optimized for Apple Silicon but large models may still require significant RAM
   - Try using a smaller/quantized model
   - Close other applications to free up memory

4. **Poor TTS quality**:
   - Ensure the text is clear and well-punctuated
   - Try shorter sentences for more natural prosody

5. **VAD not detecting speech**:
   - Check microphone levels (speak clearly and at normal volume)
   - Adjust VAD threshold: `--vad-threshold 0.3` for more sensitivity
   - Ensure no background noise is interfering
   - Try disabling VAD with `--no-vad` to test if microphone works

6. **Whisper transcription hanging**:
   - Try using a smaller model: `--whisper-model tiny.en`
   - Check if audio files in `./output/` directory play correctly
   - Ensure you have sufficient CPU/RAM available
   - The first transcription may be slower due to model initialization

## Future Plans & Roadmap

### Language Support

Currently, LocalTalk supports English (American and British accents). **Chinese language support is coming next**, with other major world languages to follow. The underlying models (Whisper, Gemma3, and Kokoro) already have multilingual capabilities - we just need to wire up the language detection and configuration.

**Contributors welcome!** If you'd like to help add support for your language, please check our [Issues](https://github.com/anthonywu/localtalk/issues) page or submit a PR. Language additions mainly involve:

- Configuring Whisper for the target language
- Testing Gemma3's response quality in that language
- Setting up ChatterBox TTS with appropriate voice models
- Adding language-specific prompts and examples

### Offline Knowledge Base

We're planning to add support for **offline data sources** to augment the LLM's knowledge while maintaining complete privacy:

- **Offline Wikipedia**: Full-text search and retrieval from Wikipedia dumps
- **Personal Documents**: Index and query your own documents, notes, and PDFs
- **Technical Documentation**: Offline access to programming docs, manuals, and references
- **Custom Knowledge Bases**: Import and index any structured data source

This will enable LocalTalk to provide informed responses about current events, technical topics, and personal information - all while keeping everything local and private on your device. The RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline will seamlessly integrate with the voice interface.

### Other Planned Features

- **Real-time streaming**: Stream responses as they're generated
- **Multi-turn conversations**: Better context management for longer discussions
- **Custom wake words**: "Hey LocalTalk" activation
- **Model hot-swapping**: Switch between models without restarting
- **Voice profiles**: Save and switch between different voice configurations
- **Plugin system**: Extend functionality with custom modules
- **Platform support**: Linux support (P2), Windows consideration (P3)
