SubEntity — Temporary Consciousness Traversal (v2.1)

A SubEntity is a temporary consciousness fragment that traverses the graph
with query (what to find) and intention (why finding it).

Schema: docs/schema/schema.yaml v2.0
Patterns: docs/physics/subentity/PATTERNS_SubEntity.md (P1-P11)
Algorithm: docs/physics/subentity/ALGORITHM_SubEntity.md

v2.1 CHANGES (Semantic Intention):
- Removed IntentionType enum (SUMMARIZE, VERIFY, etc.) - was rigid and keyword-based
- Removed INTENTION_WEIGHTS dict - intention weight is now fixed constant (0.25)
- Intention meaning is now fully semantic via intention_embedding
- Simpler, more flexible: any intention string, embedded semantically

v2.0 CHANGES (Awareness Depth + Breadth):
- awareness_depth: [up, down] - unbounded accumulator tracking hierarchy traversals
- progress_history: list of deltas toward intention (for fatigue detection)
- Fatigue-based stopping: stop when progress stagnates for 5 steps
- Children crystallize systematically (unless 90%+ match found)
- NO propagation from children to parent — graph is source of truth
- See: docs/physics/mechanisms/MECHANISMS_Awareness_Depth_Breadth.md

v1.9 CHANGES (Energy Injection):
- SubEntity injects energy at EACH traversal step (no decay)
- Injection = criticality × STATE_MULTIPLIER[state]
- Permanence converts energy to weight: weight_gain = injection × permanence
- Creates "heat trails" that persist after exploration
- New ABSORBING state for content processing

v1.8 CHANGES (Query vs Intention):
- query + query_embedding: WHAT we're searching for (semantic matching)
- intention + intention_embedding: WHY we're searching (traversal coloring)
- Link score combines query and intention alignment

v1.7.2 DESIGN DECISIONS:
- D1: sibling_ids are strings, resolved via ExplorationContext (lazy refs)
- D3: found_narratives is dict[str, float] with max(alignment) merge
- D5: Branch threshold is len(outgoing) >= 2

STATE MACHINE:
    SEEKING      -> exploring, choosing next link by score
    BRANCHING    -> multiple valid paths, running children on Moments
    ABSORBING    -> processing content at current position (v1.9)
    RESONATING   -> arrived at narrative, measuring alignment
    REFLECTING   -> backpropagating colors through path
    CRYSTALLIZING -> creating new narrative from traversal
    MERGING      -> integrating child results, returning to parent

KEY FORMULAS (v2.1):
    injection = criticality × STATE_MULTIPLIER[state]
    weight_gain = injection × permanence (energy → weight conversion)
    alignment = 0.75 × query_alignment + 0.25 × intention_alignment  (INTENTION_WEIGHT=0.25)
    link_score = base × alignment × self_novelty × sibling_divergence × emotional_factor
    crystallization_embedding = 0.4×query + 0.25×intention + 0.3×position + 0.2×found + 0.1×path
    criticality = (1 - satisfaction) × (depth / (depth + 1))

STATE MULTIPLIERS:
    SEEKING: 0.5       # Low: exploring, not yet committed
    ABSORBING: 1.0     # Normal: absorbing content
    RESONATING: 2.0    # High: found aligned narrative
    CRYSTALLIZING: 1.5 # Medium-high: creating new narrative
