## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-29

- Created full doc chain for fill-gaps capability
- Defined 3 problems in VOCABULARY: DOC_GAPS, DOC_DUPLICATION, LARGE_DOC_MODULE
- Defined 3 health indicators (H1, H2, H3) with on_signal handlers
- Documented algorithms for gap detection, duplication detection, size detection
- Documented algorithms for gap filling, deduplication, doc splitting
- Defined validation invariants (V1-V6)
- Created task templates for each problem type
- Created skill and procedure definitions

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Implement runtime checks** — runtime/checks.py with @check decorators
2. **Test gap detection** — Verify @mind:gap pattern matching
3. **Test duplication detection** — Verify similarity threshold
4. **Test size detection** — Verify line counting
5. **Integrate with mind doctor** — Wire up capability

## HANDOFF

**For next agent:**

The fill-gaps capability doc chain is complete. It defines problems (DOC_GAPS, DOC_DUPLICATION, LARGE_DOC_MODULE), health indicators with on_signal handlers, and the full detection-resolution-validation flow.

Three distinct workflows:
1. Gap filling: Find @mind:gap markers, research content, replace marker
2. Deduplication: Find overlapping docs, choose canonical, replace with refs
3. Doc splitting: Find >200 line docs, split SYNC by archiving or split others by section

Next work is implementing runtime/checks.py with the detection logic.

**Agent posture:** groundwork (implementing checks) or voice (filling actual gaps)
