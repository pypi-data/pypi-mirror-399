## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-29

- Created full doc chain for fix-membrane capability
- Defined 4 problems in VOCABULARY (MEMBRANE_NO_PROTOCOLS, MEMBRANE_PARSE_ERROR, MEMBRANE_INVALID_STEP, MEMBRANE_MISSING_FIELDS)
- Defined 4 health indicators (H1-H4) with on_signal handlers
- Created 4 task templates for each problem type
- Created SKILL_fix_procedure for agent repairs
- Created PROCEDURE_fix_membrane.yaml for step-by-step fixing

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Implement runtime** - runtime/checks.py with @check decorators
2. **Add to doctor** - Register capability with mind doctor
3. **Test detection** - Create broken procedures to test detection
4. **Test repair** - Verify automated repairs work correctly

---

## HANDOFF

**For next agent:**

The fix-membrane capability doc chain is complete. It handles 4 membrane problems related to procedure YAML files: missing procedures, parse errors, invalid steps, and missing fields.

Each problem has a corresponding task template and health indicator. The SKILL_fix_procedure guides agents through repairs, and PROCEDURE_fix_membrane.yaml provides step-by-step execution.

Next work is implementing the Python runtime in runtime/checks.py.

**Agent posture:** groundwork (implementing runtime) or keeper (testing validation)
