## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-29

- Created full doc chain for solve-markers capability
- Defined 4 problems in VOCABULARY: ESCALATION, SUGGESTION, LEGACY_MARKER, UNRESOLVED_QUESTION
- Defined 4 health indicators (H1-H4) with on_signal handlers
- Documented algorithms for detection, classification, resolution
- Defined validation invariants (V1-V6)
- Created task templates for each problem type
- Created skill and procedure

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Implement runtime checks** — runtime/checks.py with @check decorators
2. **Test detection** — Verify marker scanning works on real codebase
3. **Integration test** — End-to-end: detect → task → resolve → verify

---

## HANDOFF

**For next agent:**

The solve-markers capability doc chain is complete. It defines 4 problems (ESCALATION, SUGGESTION, LEGACY_MARKER, UNRESOLVED_QUESTION), corresponding health indicators with on_signal handlers, and resolution algorithms for each.

Key patterns:
- Escalations are critical, need decisions within 48h
- Propositions need evaluation within 7d
- Legacy markers need triage within 30d
- Questions need answers within 14d

Next work is implementing the runtime checks in Python and testing on a real codebase.

**Agent posture:** groundwork (implementing runtime) or witness (testing detection)
