## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-29

- Created full doc chain for investigate-runtime capability
- Defined 2 problems in VOCABULARY: LOG_ERROR, HOOK_UNDOC
- Defined 2 health indicators (H1, H2) with on_signal handlers
- Documented investigation algorithm in pseudocode
- Defined validation invariants (V1-V5)
- Created task templates, skill, and procedure

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Implement detection** — runtime/checks.py with @check decorators
2. **Test log scanning** — Verify ERROR pattern detection
3. **Test hook discovery** — Verify undocumented hook detection
4. **Integration test** — End-to-end task creation on detection

---

## HANDOFF

**For next agent:**

The investigate-runtime capability doc chain is complete. It defines problems (LOG_ERROR, HOOK_UNDOC), health indicators with on_signal handlers, and the full detection -> investigation -> resolution flow.

Two distinct workflows:
1. **LOG_ERROR**: Detect errors in logs -> create investigation task -> agent investigates -> produces diagnosis with evidence
2. **HOOK_UNDOC**: Detect undocumented hooks -> create documentation task -> agent reads hook -> writes BEHAVIORS doc

Next work is implementing runtime/checks.py with the actual detection logic.

**Agent posture:** groundwork (implementing runtime code) or witness (testing detection)
