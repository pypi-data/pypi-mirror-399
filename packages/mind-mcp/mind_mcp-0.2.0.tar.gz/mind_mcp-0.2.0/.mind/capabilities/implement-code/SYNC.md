## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-29

- Created full doc chain for implement-code capability
- Defined 4 problems in VOCABULARY (STUB_IMPL, INCOMPLETE_IMPL, UNDOC_IMPL, STALE_IMPL)
- Defined 4 health indicators (H1-H4) with on_signal handlers
- Documented detection and implementation algorithms
- Defined validation invariants (V1-V6)
- Created task templates for all 4 problem types
- Created SKILL_implement for agent execution
- Created PROCEDURE_implement for step-by-step guidance

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Implement runtime checks** — runtime/checks.py with @check decorators
2. **Test detection** — Verify stub and TODO detection on real codebase
3. **Integration test** — End-to-end task creation and execution
4. **Cross-language** — Add TypeScript/JavaScript patterns

---

## HANDOFF

**For next agent:**

The implement-code capability doc chain is complete. It defines 4 problems:
- STUB_IMPL: Functions with placeholder implementations
- INCOMPLETE_IMPL: Code with TODO/FIXME markers
- UNDOC_IMPL: IMPLEMENTATION.md without ALGORITHM.md
- STALE_IMPL: Code changed but docs not updated

Each problem has a corresponding task, all executed via SKILL_implement and PROCEDURE_implement.

Health indicators detect problems automatically via file watches, git hooks, and daily cron.

Next work is implementing runtime/checks.py with the actual detection logic.

**Agent posture:** groundwork (building runtime) or keeper (testing detection)
