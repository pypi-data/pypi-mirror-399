## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-29

- Created full doc chain for improve-quality capability
- Defined 6 problems in VOCABULARY (MONOLITH, MAGIC_VALUES, HARDCODED_SECRET, LONG_PROMPT, LONG_SQL, NAMING_CONVENTION)
- Defined 6 health indicators (H1-H6) with on_signal handlers
- Documented detection and resolution algorithms
- Defined validation invariants (V1-V8)
- Created 6 task templates
- Created SKILL_refactor and PROCEDURE_refactor

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Implement runtime checks** — runtime/checks.py with @check decorators
2. **Implement scripts** — extract_constants, extract_secrets, rename_to_convention
3. **Test detection** — Run against sample codebase
4. **Integrate with doctor** — Add to `mind doctor` scan

---

## HANDOFF

**For next agent:**

The improve-quality capability doc chain is complete. It defines 6 quality problems with their detection algorithms, resolution strategies (script or agent), and validation criteria.

Key points:
- HARDCODED_SECRET is critical severity, always blocks
- MONOLITH requires agent judgment for split points
- MAGIC_VALUES, HARDCODED_SECRET, NAMING_CONVENTION can be script-resolved
- LONG_PROMPT and LONG_SQL require agent judgment

Next work is implementing the Python runtime checks in runtime/checks.py.

**Agent posture:** groundwork (implementing runtime) or fixer (testing detection)
