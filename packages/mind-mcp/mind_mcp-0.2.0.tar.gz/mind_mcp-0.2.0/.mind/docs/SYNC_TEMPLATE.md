{What exists and is working — not a list, a narrative of where things stand}

---

## IN PROGRESS

### {Work Item}

- **Started:** {date}
- **By:** {agent/human}  
- **Status:** {in progress / blocked / almost done}
- **Context:** {why this matters, what's tricky about it, where you are mentally}

---

## RECENT CHANGES

### {DATE}: {Change Summary}

- **What:** {description}
- **Why:** {motivation, not just what but why it mattered}
- **Files:** {affected files}
- **Struggles/Insights:** {what was hard, what you learned, ideas that came up}

---

## KNOWN ISSUES

### {Issue}

- **Severity:** {critical / high / medium / low}
- **Symptom:** {observable problem}
- **Suspected cause:** {your theory}
- **Attempted:** {what you tried, why it didn't work}

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

**Your likely VIEW:** {VIEW_Implement / VIEW_Debug / VIEW_Extend / etc.}

**Where I stopped:** {specific point in the work}

**What you need to understand:**
{The key context that isn't in the docs yet. The thing that would take you 20 minutes to figure out but I can tell you in 3 sentences.}

**Watch out for:**
{Traps, gotchas, things that look obvious but aren't}

**Open questions I had:**
{Things I wasn't sure about — maybe you'll see the answer}

---

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

**Executive summary:**
{2-3 sentences: What was accomplished. What state things are in. What needs attention.}

**Decisions made:**
{Key choices with brief rationale. Things the human should know about or might want to revisit.}

**Needs your input:**
{Anything blocked on human decision or context only human has.}

---

## TODO

### Doc/Impl Drift

{Track when docs and implementation are out of sync. Remove items as they're resolved.}

- [ ] DOCS→IMPL: {doc changed, implementation needs updating}
- [ ] IMPL→DOCS: {implementation changed, docs need updating}

### Tests to Run

```bash
{test command for this module}
```

### Immediate

- [ ] {Next concrete step}
- [ ] {Next step after that}

### Later

- [ ] {Less urgent}
- IDEA: {Thing that occurred to me, might be good, not sure}

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

{This section is for rich context that doesn't fit elsewhere. Your future self (or the next agent) will thank you.}

**Mental state when stopping:**
{Were you confident? Confused? Excited about something? Frustrated?}

**Threads I was holding:**
{Multiple things you were tracking mentally that aren't captured in code yet}

**Intuitions:**
{Hunches about how things should work, even if not fully formed}

**What I wish I'd known at the start:**
{If you could tell past-you something, what would it be?}
