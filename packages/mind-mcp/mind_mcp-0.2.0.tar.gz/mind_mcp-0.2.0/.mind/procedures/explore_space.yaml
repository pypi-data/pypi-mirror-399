description: Understand what exists in a space before taking action - foundation for all other protocols - rich format

triggers:
  - gap: "Starting any work on a module/space"
  - event: "Doctor detects need to understand current state"

contextual_knowledge:
  domain: |
    Spaces = containers for module knowledge (narratives, moments, things).
    Exploration precedes action - understand before modifying.
    Graph structure: space → contains → narratives/things
    Narratives have types: objective, pattern, behavior, validation, health
    Things represent code artifacts with docking points.
  constraints: |
    - Never modify without exploring first
    - Capture exploration in moment node (traceable)
    - Note gaps, inconsistencies, open questions
  dependencies: |
    - Space must exist (or be identifiable)
    - Enables: all other protocols (add_objectives, add_patterns, etc.)
  quality_criteria: |
    Good exploration: "Found 3 objectives, 2 patterns, no behaviors defined. Gap: validation coverage missing for core invariants."
    Bad exploration: "Looked at the module."

steps:
  identify_space:
    type: ask
    context: |
      Exploration starts by identifying where to look.
      Spaces correspond to modules defined in modules.yaml.
