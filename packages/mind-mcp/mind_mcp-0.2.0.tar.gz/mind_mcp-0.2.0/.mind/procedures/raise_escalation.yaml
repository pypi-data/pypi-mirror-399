description: Create an escalation node when progress is blocked and external input is needed - rich format

triggers:
  - event: "Investigation reveals blocker needing human/external decision"
  - event: "Stuck on ambiguous requirements"
  - event: "Resource or permission needed"

contextual_knowledge:
  domain: |
    Escalations in mind:
    - Escalation = blocker that needs external input to resolve
    - Always includes: context, options, recommendation
    - Links to affected nodes via `about`
    - Linked FROM investigation moment that raised it

    Escalation lifecycle:
    1. Raised (this protocol)
    2. Acknowledged (human sees it)
    3. Resolved (resolve_blocker protocol)

    Never-stop principle:
    - If blocked, escalate AND propose a path forward
    - Don't just stop; make progress while waiting
  constraints: |
    - Must describe what's blocking
    - Must provide options (at least 2)
    - Must include recommended path
    - Should link to affected nodes
  quality_criteria: |
    Good escalation: "Need decision on auth approach. Options: (A) JWT with refresh tokens, (B) Session-based with cookies. Recommend A for API-first architecture. Blocked: can't implement auth module without this decision."
    Bad escalation: "Need help with auth"

steps:
  identify_context:
    type: ask
    auto_fetch:
      - query: { find: space }
        store_as: available_spaces
      - query:
          find: moment
          type: investigation
          limit: 5
        store_as: recent_investigations
    context: |
      Escalations flag blockers that need external input.
      First, identify the context.
