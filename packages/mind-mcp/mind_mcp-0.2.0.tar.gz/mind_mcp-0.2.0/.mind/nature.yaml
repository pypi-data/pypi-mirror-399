# Nature Vocabulary
#
# Unified vocabulary for links AND nodes. Use adverb forms that work for both:
#   - Link: "urgently concerns", "cautiously blocks"
#   - Node: nature: "urgently" (means "this is urgent")
#
# Format: [modifier] + [verb]
#
# Examples:
#   "serves"
#   "urgently serves"
#   "cautiously, with difficulty"
#   "unreliably imports"
#   "speculatively resolves, temporarily"

# =============================================================================
# VERBS (for links)
# =============================================================================

structural:
  - verb: serves
    when: Linking an instance to its template (task_run → task, actor → actor_template)
    result: System recognizes instance-template relationship, queries for instances return this node

  - verb: includes
    when: Creating hierarchy or containment (space → subspace, category → item)
    result: Child appears in parent's contents, hierarchy queries traverse this link

  - verb: imports
    when: Recording code/module dependencies (module → library, file → package)
    result: Dependency graph includes this edge, impact analysis finds dependents

  - verb: describes
    when: Linking documentation to what it documents (README → module, PATTERNS → system)
    result: Subject shows related docs, doc queries find this documentation

action:
  - verb: concerns
    when: Connecting an action to what it operates on (task_run → target node)
    result: Task is associated with target, target shows related actions

  - verb: claims
    when: Recording ownership (actor → task_run, user → resource)
    result: Resource marked as owned, others see it as unavailable

  - verb: resolves
    when: Task successfully addresses a problem (task_run → problem, fix → bug)
    result: Problem marked as addressed, detection stops flagging it

  - verb: blocks
    when: Recording what prevents progress (blocker → blocked, dependency → dependent)
    result: Blocked item shows as waiting, unblock queries find blockers

capability:
  - verb: uses
    when: Recording tool/skill usage (task → skill, process → utility)
    result: Capability linked to consumer, usage tracking possible

  - verb: executes
    when: Recording what runs what (task → procedure, runner → script)
    result: Execution path defined, procedure loaded when task runs

  - verb: requires
    when: Recording prerequisites (task → prerequisite, step → prior_step)
    result: Must be satisfied before proceeding, ordering enforced

  - verb: enables
    when: Recording what makes something possible (capability → action, permission → operation)
    result: Action possible only when enabler present

evidence:
  - verb: proves
    when: Strong evidence confirming a claim (test_result → hypothesis, data → theory)
    result: Claim strengthened, confidence increased significantly

  - verb: refutes
    when: Strong evidence against a claim (counterexample → hypothesis)
    result: Claim weakened, may trigger reconsideration

  - verb: supports
    when: Moderate evidence for a claim (observation → theory)
    result: Claim somewhat strengthened, adds to body of evidence

  - verb: contradicts
    when: Evidence conflicts with claim (finding → assumption)
    result: Inconsistency flagged, needs resolution

  - verb: suggests
    when: Weak indication of possibility (hint → hypothesis)
    result: Possibility noted, warrants investigation
