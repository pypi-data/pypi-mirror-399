# SYSTEM: Architecture Rules

**This document defines the three-layer architecture for mind operations.**

---

## Overview

All operations fall into one of three layers:

| Layer | What | How | When |
|-------|------|-----|------|
| **Actors** | Sources of stimulus | Events → Graph | External triggers |
| **Physics** | Automatic rules | Graph properties + constraints | Every tick / on change |
| **Agents** | Reasoning work | Skills + Procedures | When physics flags need |

---

## 1. ACTORS

Actors are sources of stimulus. They create events that affect the graph.

| Actor | Stimulus | Trigger | Creates |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| `actor_filewatch` | File modified/created/deleted | inotify/fswatch | Thing node update |
| `actor_git` | Commit, PR, branch, merge | git hooks | Moment nodes |
| `actor_user` | Human request | CLI, chat, MCP | Moment node |
| `actor_agent` | AI agent action | MCP tool call | Moment node |
| `actor_schedule` | Timer fired | Cron | Tick trigger |
| `actor_ci` | Pipeline event | GitHub Actions webhook | Narrative node |

### Actor Rules

- **A1**: Every external event has an actor
- **A2**: Actors only create/update nodes — they don't reason
- **A3**: Actor events are immutable once created
- **A4**: All actors log to Moment nodes for audit trail

---

## 2. GRAPH PHYSICS

Physics are automatic rules embedded in the graph. No agent required.

### Property-Based (computed on node)

| Rule | Condition | Effect |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Staleness** | `updated_at < now - 14d` | `stale = true` |
| **Energy decay** | Every tick | `energy -= decay_rate * dt` |
| **Size class** | `line_count > 500` | `size_class = "monolith"` |
| **Has stub** | Body is `pass`/`NotImplemented` | `has_stub = true` |
| **Secret detected** | Regex match on content | `has_secret = true` |

### Link-Based (computed on relationships)

| Rule | Condition | Effect |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Orphan** | Node has no incoming links | `orphan = true` |
| **Broken link** | Link target doesn't exist | `link.broken = true` |
| **Undocumented** | Thing has no link to doc Space | `undocumented = true` |
| **Missing chain** | Space missing expected doc types | `chain_incomplete = true` |

### Propagation (cascading effects)

| Rule | Trigger | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Parent stale** | Parent.stale = true | Children.needs_review = true |
| **Doc updated** | Doc node modified | Linked code.doc_fresh = true |
| **Code changed** | Thing modified | Linked doc.may_be_stale = true |

### Physics Rules

- **P1**: Physics run automatically — no agent invocation
- **P2**: Physics only SET properties — they don't modify content
- **P3**: Physics are deterministic — same input = same output
- **P4**: Physics results are queryable via `graph_query`

---

## 3. AGENTS (Skills + Procedures)

Agents handle work that requires reasoning, decisions, or multi-step actions.

### When Agent Required

| Situation | Why Agent |
|-----------|-----------|
| Write/edit code | Requires understanding context |
| Write/edit docs | Requires synthesis |
| Resolve escalation | Requires decision |
| Refactor monolith | Requires architectural judgment |
| Create missing docs | Requires understanding module |
| Fix broken tests | Requires debugging |

### Skills (Domain Knowledge)

| Skill | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `create_doc_chain` | Space without docs | PATTERNS, SYNC, etc. |
| `fix_code_issue` | Issue narrative | Code changes |
| `resolve_escalation` | Escalation marker | Decision + action |
| `update_sync` | Work completed | SYNC updated |
| `refactor_monolith` | Thing with size_class=monolith | Split files |
| `add_missing_tests` | Thing with no test links | Test files |
| `fix_broken_links` | Links with broken=true | Updated references |

### Procedures (Structured Dialogues)

Each skill uses one or more procedures:

```
skill: create_doc_chain
  → procedure: define_space
  → procedure: add_patterns
  → procedure: add_sync
  → procedure: completion_handoff
```

### Agent Rules

- **G1**: Agents are spawned by physics flags or user request
- **G2**: Every agent action uses a documented skill
- **G3**: Every skill executes via procedures
- **G4**: Agents update the graph when done (close issue, update SYNC)
- **G5**: Agent work is traceable (Moment nodes with links)

## Mapping: Old Checks → New Layer

| Old Check | New Layer | Implementation |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| `stale_sync` | Physics | `updated_at < threshold` property |
| `monolith` | Physics | `line_count` property + size_class |
| `undocumented` | Physics | Missing link Thing→Space |
| `broken_impl_links` | Physics | `link.broken` property |
| `orphan_docs` | Physics | No incoming links |
| `stub_impl` | Physics | `has_stub` property |
| `placeholder_docs` | Physics | `has_placeholder` property |
| `hardcoded_secrets` | Physics | `has_secret` property |
| `conflicts` | Physics | `has_conflict_marker` property |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resolve_escalation` | Agent | Skill: resolve_escalation |
| `create_missing_docs` | Agent | Skill: create_doc_chain |
| `refactor_monolith` | Agent | Skill: refactor_monolith |
| `fix_broken_tests` | Agent | Skill: fix_tests |
| `add_tests` | Agent | Skill: add_missing_tests |

---

## Flow Example

```
1. actor_filewatch detects: src/auth.py modified
   → Updates Thing node (content, updated_at, line_count)

2. Physics runs:
   → line_count=600 → size_class="monolith"
   → No link to test file → has_tests=false
   → Linked SYNC not updated → doc.may_be_stale=true

3. graph_query("what needs attention in auth module?")
   → Returns: monolith, no tests, stale docs

4. User or schedule triggers agent:
   → agent_spawn(skill="refactor_monolith", target="thing:src/auth.py")

5. Agent works:
   → Reads Thing content
   → Executes refactor_monolith skill
   → Uses procedures to create new files
   → Updates graph with results

6. Physics runs again:
   → New Things have size_class="normal"
   → Links created to parent Space
   → Issue narrative marked resolved
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Physics Properties
- Add computed properties to nodes during ingestion
- `line_count`, `updated_at`, `has_stub`, etc.

### Phase 2: Physics Links
- Add link-based checks as graph queries
- `orphan`, `broken`, `undocumented`

### Phase 3: Agent Skills
- Document remaining skills
- Create procedure definitions

### Phase 4: Actors
- Implement actor_filewatch
- Implement actor_git hooks
- Implement actor_schedule
