# Doctor Ignore Configuration
#
# This file lists issues that should be suppressed by `mind doctor`.
# Use this for verified false positives or intentional exceptions.
#
# Each entry requires:
#   - task_type: The issue type to suppress (e.g., MONOLITH, HARDCODED_SECRET)
#   - path: File/directory path or glob pattern (e.g., src/legacy/*, tests/**)
#   - reason: Explanation of why this is being ignored (for audit trail)
#
# Optional fields:
#   - added_by: Who added this entry (agent name, human, etc.)
#   - added_date: When added (YYYY-MM-DD)
#
# Example entries:
#
# ignores:
#   - task_type: MONOLITH
#     path: src/generated/schema.py
#     reason: Auto-generated file, splitting not practical
#     added_by: human
#     added_date: 2025-01-15
#
#   - task_type: HARDCODED_SECRET
#     path: tests/fixtures/**
#     reason: Test fixtures use fake credentials
#     added_by: agent
#     added_date: 2025-01-15
#
#   - task_type: MAGIC_VALUES
#     path: src/constants.py
#     reason: This IS the constants file
#     added_by: human
#     added_date: 2025-01-15
#
# Pattern matching:
#   - Exact: "src/file.py" matches only that file
#   - Glob: "tests/**" matches all files under tests/
#   - Wildcard: "*" with task_type suppresses ALL issues of that type (use sparingly)
