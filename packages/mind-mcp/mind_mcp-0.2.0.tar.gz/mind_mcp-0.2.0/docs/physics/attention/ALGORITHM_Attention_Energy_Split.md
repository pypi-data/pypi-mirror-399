## OVERVIEW

Attention is a conserved budget distributed across sinks in the player
neighborhood. Mass is computed from focus, link axes, and visibility, then
softmaxed to produce allocations.

---

## PROCEDURE (ABRIDGED)

```
N = player_neighborhood(player, place)
S = { n in N | type(n) in {MOMENT, NARRATIVE} }
mass(s) = clamp(focus_term * link_term * vis_term)
share(s) = softmax(mass(s) / ctx.attention_temp)
alloc(s) = E * share(s)
moment.energy_next = blend(moment.energy_prev, alloc, ctx.energy_inertia)
```
