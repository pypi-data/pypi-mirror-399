## SUMMARY

The physics validation guidance now splits invariants and procedures into dedicated fragments so each stays readable. Follow the linked sections for the full invariants, performance benchmarks, error conditions, and verification checklist.

## FRAMEWORK

- `VALIDATION_Physics/VALIDATION_Physics_Invariants.md` — core invariants covering graph truth, handler isolation, energy conservation, status enums, action sequencing, and question answering constraints.
- `VALIDATION_Physics/VALIDATION_Physics_Procedures.md` — properties, error conditions, coverage notes, verification procedures, and documentation sync requirements.
