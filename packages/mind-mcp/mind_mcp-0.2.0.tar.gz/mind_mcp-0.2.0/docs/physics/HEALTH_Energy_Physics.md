# Energy Physics — Health: Verification Mechanics and Coverage

```
@mind:id: HEALTH.PHYSICS.ENERGY.V1.2
STATUS: DRAFT

## PURPOSE OF THIS FILE

This HEALTH file verifies the energy physics system operates correctly at runtime. It protects:
- **Energy conservation**: No leaks, no infinite accumulation, no negative values
- **Link state integrity**: Hot/cold transitions follow rules, top-N filter works correctly
- **Tick ordering**: Phases execute in correct sequence, no race conditions
- **Moment lifecycle**: State transitions follow allowed paths
- **Agent-physics boundary**: Agents create moments, physics flows energy (never crossed)

Who relies on it:
- **Players**: Narrative coherence depends on correct energy flow
- **Narrator/World Builder agents**: Their outputs must produce valid moments
- **Operators**: System stability under load

Boundaries:
- This file verifies physics runtime behavior
- Does NOT verify agent LLM output quality (separate concern)
- Does NOT verify graph database operations (separate HEALTH file)

---

## WHY THIS PATTERN

Tests pass but runtime fails when:
- Energy accumulates over thousands of ticks (not caught in short tests)
- Link cooling rate causes all links to go cold (dead world)
- Top-N filter excludes critical links under load
- Moment creation rate exceeds physics tick rate

Docking-based checks work here because:
- Physics has clear input/output boundaries (tick start → tick end)
- Energy values are observable without changing implementation
- Link states can be sampled without interrupting flow

Throttling protects:
- Physics runs at 5-second ticks; health checks run at 1-minute intervals
- Burst checks during high-activity scenes limited to 10/minute

| `expresses` | Actor → Moment | Draw |
| `about` | Moment → Any | Flow |
| `relates` | Any → Any | Flow, Backflow |

|------|-----------|
| `contains` | Space → Actor/Thing |
| `leads_to` | Space → Space |
| `sequence` | Moment → Moment |

## HEALTH INDICATORS SELECTED

## OBJECTIVES COVERAGE

| Objective | Indicators | Why These Signals Matter |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------|
| Energy Conservation | energy_balance, no_negative_energy | Leaks cause dead worlds or runaway accumulation |
| Link Integrity | link_hot_cold_ratio, link_strength_growth | All cold = dead; no growth = no memory |
| Tick Correctness | tick_phase_order, tick_completion_rate | Wrong order = wrong physics |
| Moment Lifecycle | moment_state_validity, moment_throughput | Stuck moments = frozen narrative |
| Proximity Calculation | proximity_bounds, proximity_correlation | Wrong proximity = wrong generation |

```yaml
health_indicators:
  - name: energy_balance
    flow_id: tick_execution
    priority: high
    rationale: Total system energy should be bounded; unbounded growth or leaks break narrative

  - name: no_negative_energy
    flow_id: moment_draw
    priority: high
    rationale: Negative energy is invalid state; indicates formula error

  - name: link_hot_cold_ratio
    flow_id: link_cooling
    priority: high
    rationale: If ratio drops below threshold, world goes dead; if never cools, memory explodes

  - name: link_strength_growth
    flow_id: link_traversal
    priority: med
    rationale: Zero growth means no persistent memory; runaway growth indicates formula error

  - name: tick_phase_order
    flow_id: tick_execution
    priority: high
    rationale: Out-of-order phases produce wrong physics results

  - name: tick_completion_rate
    flow_id: tick_execution
    priority: high
    rationale: Incomplete ticks leave system in invalid state

  - name: moment_state_validity
    flow_id: moment_lifecycle
    priority: high
    rationale: Invalid transitions break narrative coherence

  - name: moment_throughput
    flow_id: moment_lifecycle
    priority: med
    rationale: Throughput mismatch indicates backpressure or stuck moments

  - name: proximity_bounds
    flow_id: energy_generation
    priority: med
    rationale: Proximity outside [0,1] indicates path calculation error

  - name: top_n_coverage
    flow_id: top_n_filter
    priority: med
    rationale: Important links excluded = narrative holes

  validation:
    - validation_id: V-STRENGTH-FORMULA
      criteria: Strength grows per formula with diminishing returns
```

### HEALTH REPRESENTATION

```yaml
representation:
  selected:
    - float_0_1
  semantics:
    float_0_1: average growth rate across sampled links (normalized)
  aggregation:
    method: mean
    display: float_0_1
```

### DOCKS SELECTED

```yaml
docks:
  input:
    id: DOCK-TRAVERSAL
    method: engine.physics.flow.energy_flows_through
    location: runtime/physics/flow.py:15
  output:
    id: DOCK-TRAVERSAL
    method: engine.physics.flow.energy_flows_through
    location: runtime/physics/flow.py:25
```

### ALGORITHM / CHECK MECHANISM

```yaml
mechanism:
  summary: Sample link strength before/after traversals; verify growth matches formula
  steps:
    - Sample 100 random traversals per tick
    - Record strength before and after
    - Calculate actual growth
    - Calculate expected growth from formula
    - Compare (allow 1% tolerance for float precision)
  data_required: Link strength values, traversal parameters
  failure_mode: Mismatch indicates formula implementation error
```

### INDICATOR

```yaml
indicator:
  error:
    - name: STRENGTH_FORMULA_ERROR
      linked_validation: [V-STRENGTH-FORMULA]
      meaning: Actual growth doesn't match expected
      default_action: alert
  warning:
    - name: STRENGTH_ZERO_GROWTH
      linked_validation: [V-STRENGTH-FORMULA]
      meaning: No strength growth detected (possible dead traversals)
      default_action: warn
  info:
    - name: STRENGTH_GROWING
      linked_validation: [V-STRENGTH-FORMULA]
      meaning: Growth matches formula
      default_action: log
```

### THROTTLING STRATEGY

```yaml
throttling:
  trigger: tick_complete
  max_frequency: 1/min
  burst_limit: 3
  backoff: linear
```

### MANUAL RUN

```yaml
manual_run:
  command: python -m engine.physics.health.checker strength_growth
  notes: Run after formula changes
```
