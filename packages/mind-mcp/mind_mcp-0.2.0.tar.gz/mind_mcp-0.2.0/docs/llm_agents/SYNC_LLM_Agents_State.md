## MATURITY

**What's canonical (v1):**
- `gemini_agent.py` provides a Gemini CLI wrapper for the TUI/CLI.
- Streamed JSON output matches the TUI expectations used by other agents.

**What's still being designed:**
- Shared abstractions for additional LLM providers.
- Expanded tool schema support and richer message formatting for Gemini.

**What's proposed (v2+):**
- A reusable adapter base class for multi-provider consistency.
- Configurable model selection via CLI flags.

---

## CURRENT STATE

`runtime/llms/gemini_agent.py` implements a standalone CLI process that authenticates with GEMINI_API_KEY (CLI arg, `.env`, or env var), sends a prompt to Gemini, streams JSON output for the TUI, and executes basic local tools (filesystem/search/web fetch). Google search requests use a configurable base URL via `MIND_GOOGLE_SEARCH_URL`. The CLI builds the subprocess invocation from `runtime/agent_cli.py` when the `gemini` provider is selected.

---

## IN PROGRESS

No active implementation work is underway; the last changes were
documentation-only updates, and adapter behavior is unchanged.

---

## KNOWN ISSUES

No confirmed defects are tracked; the stderr model listing noise is
noted in handoff context and has not been triaged yet.

---

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

**Your likely VIEW:** `VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md`

**Where I stopped:** Documentation only; no behavior changes.

**What you need to understand:**
The Gemini adapter is a thin wrapper intended to isolate provider SDK usage. It streams JSON chunks for the TUI and supports basic local tool execution. The default model is `gemini-3-flash-preview`.

**Watch out for:**
The adapter prints model listings to stderr unconditionally; consider gating if that output is noisy.

**Open questions I had:**
Should we standardize adapter helpers for streaming JSON and error handling?

---

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

**Executive summary:**
LLM agent docs now exist for the Gemini adapter, with module mapping and a DOCS pointer added.

**Decisions made:**
Documented the module as DESIGNING and kept the chain minimal (PATTERNS + SYNC).

**Needs your input:**
None.

---

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

**Mental state when stopping:**
Calm, focused on minimal documentation to satisfy mapping requirements.

**Threads I was holding:**
Whether to document the stderr model listing as a known issue and whether to add more doc chain files.

**Intuitions:**
A shared adapter helper will likely appear once a second provider is added.

**What I wish I'd known at the start:**
That only the Gemini adapter exists, so the docs should stay lean.

## POINTERS

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Gemini adapter | `runtime/llms/gemini_agent.py` |
| CLI integration | `runtime/agent_cli.py` |


---

## TODO

<!-- @mind:todo Capture telemetry for LLM adapters (usage counts, errors, sync updates) so doctor can surface trends and the SYNC reflects real-world load. -->
