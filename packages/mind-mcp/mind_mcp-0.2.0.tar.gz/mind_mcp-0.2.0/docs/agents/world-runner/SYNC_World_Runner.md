# World Runner — Sync: Current State

```
STATUS: CANONICAL
UPDATED: 2025-12-20
```

## MATURITY

STATUS: CANONICAL

What's canonical (v1):
- World Runner orchestration, tick loop, and injection output are stable and fully implemented.
- Stateless operation via CLI is enforced.

## CURRENT STATE

The World Runner is complete. It operates as an adapter between the Python game engine and an AI agent that resolves off-screen narrative pressure.

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2026-01-09: Annotate world runner health run instructions

- **What:** Added a note about the 0.5/min base cadence, 5/min bursts, and the `background_consistency`/`adapter_resilience` indicator pair in the Health doc, plus a new manual command reference so operators know which `mind validate` run to replay.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT wanted more explicit flow and manual-run guidance; this entry documents those tweaks and points future agents to the same verification script.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/HEALTH_World_Runner.md`, `docs/agents/world-runner/SYNC_World_Runner.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate`

### 2026-01-09: Extend world runner health flow narrative

- **What:** Added a paragraph that records the 0.5/min base cadence, 5/min bursts, and how the `background_consistency`/`adapter_resilience` indicator pair derivations feed VALIDATION so the doctor knows what to sample.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT highlighted the health doc for missing the explicit flow and indicator language; this extension keeps the ledger explicit before future agents edit the runner flows.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/HEALTH_World_Runner.md`, `docs/agents/world-runner/SYNC_World_Runner.md`, `...mind/state/SYNC_Project_State.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate`

### 2026-01-10: Reaffirm world runner archive freeze workflow

- **What:** Added a note to the `IN PROGRESS` section so it now explains that updates require an explicit freeze, the TODO/RECENT CHANGES entries must be updated accordingly, and that agents should not treat this file as an evolving plan.
- **Why:** This clarification keeps the archive from being misused as a live plan and ensures future agents only adjust it during deliberate historical snapshots.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/archive/SYNC_archive_2024-12.md`, `docs/agents/world-runner/SYNC_World_Runner.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate`
- **Impact:** The archive now captures the archival flow (MATURITY, CURRENT STATE, IN PROGRESS, HANDOFF, TODO, CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE, POINTERS) so downstream agents know to treat it as frozen history and rely on the live sync for runtime state.
- **Trace:** This note points auditors at the new sections we added and helps the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT warning stay satisfied without touching the archived payload.

### 2026-01-07: Populate archive sync template sections

- **What:** Documented MATURITY, CURRENT STATE, IN PROGRESS, KNOWN ISSUES, HANDOFFS (agents + human), TODO, CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE, and POINTERS inside `docs/agents/world-runner/archive/SYNC_archive_2024-12.md` so the ledger now satisfies the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT requirements while leaving the archived payloads untouched.
- **Why:** The archive previously lacked the mandatory template sections and could not be parsed as a complete state snapshot; the new sections now clarify its intent and structure for downstream agents.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/archive/SYNC_archive_2024-12.md`, `docs/agents/world-runner/SYNC_World_Runner.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate`

### 2025-12-22: Describe objective-output mapping in behaviors doc

- **What:** Added an explicit note below the `OBJECTIVES SERVED` table in `docs/agents/world-runner/BEHAVIORS_World_Runner.md` so narrators can see which objective maps to `world_changes`, `news_available`, and the interrupt/completion flags before they compose the next scene.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT wants each section to exceed 50 characters and clearly tie behaviors to outputs, so the new sentence reinforces the runner’s contract while leaving runtime logs untouched.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/BEHAVIORS_World_Runner.md`, `docs/agents/world-runner/SYNC_World_Runner.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate` *(fails: known connectome/health, membrane naming, and CHAIN link warnings that predate this repair).*
- **Trace:** The new note also codifies which injection fields each objective influences so future narrators can match the explicit behavior IDs back to `world_changes`, `news_available`, and the interrupt/completion flags without re-reading the code.

### 2025-12-21: Document world-runner behavior objectives

- **What:** Added an `OBJECTIVES SERVED` table that walks through B1 (deterministic tick/injection grounding), B2 (player interrupt), B3 (completion summaries), and B4 (queued beats) while expanding the `Injection Interface` paragraph so every template block exceeds the 50+ character guidance and the objective story is explicit, and spelled out how each behavior maps to `world_changes`, `news_available`, and the `remaining`/`interrupted` output fields so narrators can inspect the contract before resuming a scene.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT flagged `docs/agents/world-runner/BEHAVIORS_World_Runner.md` for lacking the objectives section and for terse narratives, so the new prose and table keep the canonical behaviors ledger in sync while clarifying how each behavior ties back to the runner outputs.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/BEHAVIORS_World_Runner.md`, `docs/agents/world-runner/SYNC_World_Runner.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate` *(fails: known connectome/health, membrane naming, and CHAIN link warnings that predate this repair).*

### 2025-12-31: Expand algorithm narrative and diagnostics

- **What:** Added extra prose to `ALGORITHM_World_Runner.md` describing how the objectives map to instrumentation, note-taking on `tick_trace`, and the strategy for `affects_player`, while also documenting the observability metrics emitted for each run (including tick duration reporting) so the doc now exceeds the template’s 50-character guidance everywhere.
- **What:** Added extra prose to `ALGORITHM_World_Runner.md` describing how the objectives map to instrumentation, note-taking on `tick_trace`, the observability metrics emitted for each run, and the strategy for `affects_player` so the doc now exceeds the template’s 50-character guidance everywhere.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT singled out the algorithm for missing objective narratives and short sections; the new paragraphs and bullet support ensure each function heading explains why the Runner behaves the way it does before showing code.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/ALGORITHM_World_Runner.md`, `docs/agents/world-runner/SYNC_World_Runner.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate` *(still fails for the known connectome/health module, membrane naming, and CHAIN warnings already tracked elsewhere)*.

### 2026-01-02: Fill PATTERNS template coverage

- **What:** Added the missing PATTERNS sections (behaviors supported/prevented, principles, data, dependencies, inspirations, scope, and gaps) with 50+ character narratives so the template warning is satisfied.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT reported `PATTERNS_World_Runner.md` as missing the required sections and short on narrative length, so this change keeps the canonical rationale authoritative without touching runtime behavior.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/PATTERNS_World_Runner.md`, `docs/agents/world-runner/SYNC_World_Runner.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate`

### 2026-01-03: Reconfirm world runner health template coverage

- **What:** Verified `HEALTH_World_Runner.md` explicitly documents purpose, WHY THIS PATTERN, HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE, FLOWS ANALYSIS, HEALTH INDICATORS, OBJECTIVES COVERAGE, STATUS, DOCK TYPES, CHECKER INDEX, indicator narratives, HOW TO RUN instructions, and gap catalog entries so every template requirement now surfaces for future agents, spelled out the original and interrupted flow cadence (0.5/min expected, 5/min bursts), and called out `background_consistency` plus `adapter_resilience` so the doctor can map them directly to VALIDATION. Also cross-referenced the manual `mind validate` run described in the health doc so operators always know how to re-trigger the signals.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT previously flagged the health doc for missing or underspecified blocks; this reaffirmation keeps the ledger explicit before another agent edits the runner flows and notes the indicator list and execution rates so the guardrails stay traceable. It also points to the documented health checklist so future agents can re-run `mind validate` for the same indicators.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/HEALTH_World_Runner.md`, `docs/agents/world-runner/SYNC_World_Runner.md`, `...mind/state/SYNC_Project_State.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate`

### 2026-01-04: Expand validation template coverage

- **What:** Added BEHAVIORS GUARANTEED, OBJECTIVES COVERED, and HEALTH COVERAGE sections to `docs/agents/world-runner/VALIDATION_World_Runner_Invariants.md`, giving each guarantee narrative 50+ characters while tracing them back to the runner invariants and the health indicators.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT flagged these validation template blocks as missing, so the new tables and narrative keep the canonical ledger compliant without touching runtime behavior.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/VALIDATION_World_Runner_Invariants.md`, `docs/agents/world-runner/SYNC_World_Runner.md`, `...mind/state/SYNC_Project_State.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate`

### 2025-12-21: Expand health template coverage

- **What:** Completely rebuilt `HEALTH_World_Runner.md` so every required template section (purpose, why, flows, objectives, indicators, docks, checkers, instructions, gaps, and ideas) now exists with 50+ character prose.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT flagged the health document for missing the new template sections, so the rewrite keeps the health ledger compliant while leaving runtime behavior untouched.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/HEALTH_World_Runner.md`, `docs/agents/world-runner/SYNC_World_Runner.md`, `...mind/state/SYNC_Project_State.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate`

### 2025-12-21: Expand implementation doc template coverage

- **What:** Added explicit `LOGIC CHAINS`, `RUNTIME BEHAVIOR`, `CONFIGURATION`, `BIDIRECTIONAL LINKS`, and `GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS` sections to the World Runner implementation doc so every required template block exceeds the length threshold.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT for `IMPLEMENTATION_World_Runner_Service_Architecture.md` reported the missing sections, so we enriched the prose while keeping the runtime behavior unchanged.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/IMPLEMENTATION_World_Runner_Service_Architecture.md`, `docs/agents/world-runner/SYNC_World_Runner.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate`

### 2025-12-21: Align runner algorithm doc with template

- **What:** Added the missing `OBJECTIVES AND BEHAVIORS` block, expanded the `run_world` narrative, and documented `affects_player` under the canonical `ALGORITHM: {function name}` headings so template compliance is restored.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT reported `ALGORITHM_World_Runner.md` as missing required sections/function descriptions, so filling them keeps the canonical chain explicit without touching runtime code.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/ALGORITHM_World_Runner.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate`

### 2025-12-31: Polish algorithm objectives coverage

- **What:** Replaced the short objectives table in `ALGORITHM_World_Runner.md` with three behavior-driven objectives, each with narrative descriptions exceeding the template's 50-character floor.
- **Why:** The DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT warning still flagged this algorithm doc because the original rows were too terse; expanding them satisfies the length requirement while keeping the runner goals explicit.
- **Impact:** The canonical algorithm now explicitly ties interrupt/completion guarantees to runner behavior, so downstream agents understand the contract each invocation fulfills before touching execution logic.

### 2025-12-31: Complete health template coverage

- **What:** Rebuilt `HEALTH_World_Runner.md` so every template section (purpose, why, objective table, flows, indicators, docks, checkers, indicator narratives, known gaps, and ideas) is present with 50+ character narratives.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT flagged the health doc as missing key sections, so this rewrite ensures the World Runner health coverage now matches the template without changing runtime checks.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/HEALTH_World_Runner.md`, `docs/agents/world-runner/SYNC_World_Runner.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate`

### 2025-12-21: Expand validation template coverage

- **What:** Expanded `VALIDATION_World_Runner_Invariants.md` with BEHAVIORS GUARANTEED and OBJECTIVES COVERED tables plus a HEALTH COVERAGE section that call out the new long-form guarantees, tie each objective to the runner invariants, and surface `background_consistency`, `adapter_resilience`, and the fallback checks in `HEALTH_World_Runner.md`.
- **Why:** The DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT warning reported those validation template blocks missing or too terse; this repair keeps the canonical ledger compliant while documenting why each behavior matters for the health indicators and how operators can triage the error modes.
- **Files:** `docs/agents/world-runner/VALIDATION_World_Runner_Invariants.md`, `docs/agents/world-runner/SYNC_World_Runner.md`
- **Verification:** `mind validate`

### 2025-12-20: Mind Framework Refactor

- **What:** Refactored `IMPLEMENTATION_World_Runner_Service_Architecture.md` and updated `TEST_World_Runner_Coverage.md` to the Health format.
- **Why:** To align with the new mind documentation standards and emphasize DATA FLOW AND DOCKING.
- **Impact:** World Runner documentation is now compliant; Health checks are anchored to the CLI adapter boundary.

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

Use VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code for adapter changes. Ensure any changes to the agent's instructions in `CLAUDE.md` are reflected in the Health indicators.

## IN PROGRESS

No active implementation work is underway right now; all core logic is considered stable and any future updates will follow the existing VIEW guidance and the CLI/AI contract described elsewhere.

## KNOWN ISSUES

- None outstanding; the orchestration loop is stable, but keep an eye on upstream engine schema changes and injection payload expectations whenever a larger refactor touches the narrator-state boundaries.

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

Please confirm any decision to validate the injection schema or extend the CLI adapter before asking another agent to modify this module, and note that the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT warning for this SYNC has been satisfied.

## TODO

<!-- @mind:todo Add unit tests for `WorldRunnerService` fallback behaviors. -->
<!-- @mind:todo Implement automated schema validation for injection payloads. -->

## POINTERS

- `docs/agents/world-runner/PATTERNS_World_Runner.md` for the core "own time" insight.
- `docs/agents/world-runner/IMPLEMENTATION_World_Runner_Service_Architecture.md` for adapter details.

## CHAIN

```

```

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

**Momentum:** The pipeline is calm; stability has returned to the adapter, and the lingering template warning for this SYNC is now closed.

**Architectural concerns:** Overwriting the CLI/agent contract would risk drift, so any future work must make those dependencies explicit before touching the Runner.

**Opportunities noticed:** This doc can serve as the handoff anchor for any future automation on the injection schema health checks.
