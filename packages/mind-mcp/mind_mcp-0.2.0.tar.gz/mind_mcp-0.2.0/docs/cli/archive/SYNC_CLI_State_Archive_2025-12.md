## MATURITY

**What's canonical (v1):**
- `init`, `validate`, `doctor`, `repair`, `sync`, `context`, `prompt`, `map`

**What's still being designed:**
- Parallel agent coordination output (works but can interleave)
- GitHub issue integration depth
- Config.yaml structure for project-specific settings

**What's proposed (v2+):**
- Watch mode for continuous health monitoring
- MCP server integration for repairs
- IDE extension/plugin support

## MERGED SNAPSHOTS

This file now subsumes the historical snapshots that were previously stored in the other `SYNC` documents below; those files now point readers here so the archive history stays centralized.

### Development snapshot (2025-12-20)

- Escaped literal escalation/proposition markers across the CLI docs to keep doc scanners honest and kept the archive focused on the same `context` as the active work.
- Repaired `spawn_repair_agent_async`, added the missing `DoctorConfig` import, and documented the improved retry/control flow.
- Added proposition support (`solve-markers`), LOG_ERROR health checks for `.log` issues, and externalized repo-overview scan length plus the SVG namespace config.
- Updated `modules.yaml` with the cleaned CLI module mapping, simplified `docs/cli` content to trim size, and verified `runtime/repair_core.py` no longer trips INCOMPLETE_IMPL false positives.

### Legacy snapshot (2024-12)

- Captures the CLI history that preceded the 2025 rework and confirms that no active work items remain in that era.
- Retains a lightweight summary of the pre-2025 features and instruction to treat the file as read-only legacy context.

The original files `SYNC_CLI_Development_State_archive_2025-12.md` and `SYNC_archive_2024-12.md` now act as pointers to this canonical archive while the content above preserves their highlights.

## CURRENT STATE

Snapshot of the CLI SYNC state as of 2025-12-18. Core commands stable; archives capture the doc chain at that point.

## IN PROGRESS

- None (archive is read-only); refer to the latest active SYNC file for current work.

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Archived content may lack recent doc-template drift fixes; check `docs/cli/core/SYNC_CLI_Development_State.md` for up-to-date state.

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

- When revisiting CLI archives, read the archive summary first, then consult `VIEW_Extend_Add_Features_To_Existing.md` if you plan to modify active docs.

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

- No action required; the archive documents the CLI state at 2025-12-18 for reference only.

## TODO

<!-- @mind:todo Consider capturing automated diffs between successive archives to track what changed between 2024 and 2025 snapshots. -->

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

- The archive is legacy state; updating it is low priority unless regression analysis demands historical context.

## POINTERS

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Active CLI SYNC | `docs/cli/core/SYNC_CLI_Development_State.md` |
| Protocol archive | `docs/mcp-design/archive/SYNC_Archive_2024-12.md` |
