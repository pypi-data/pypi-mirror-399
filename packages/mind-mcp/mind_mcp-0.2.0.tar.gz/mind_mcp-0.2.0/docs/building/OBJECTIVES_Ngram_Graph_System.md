# OBJECTIVES — mind Graph System

```
STATUS: DESIGNING
CREATED: 2024-12-23

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVES (ranked)

1. **Graph runs the dev process** — Attention flows as energy. Hot areas surface to agents. The graph decides what gets worked on, not external task lists.

2. **Docs dissolve into narratives** — Markdown files are views, not source of truth. Atomic doc sections become Narrative nodes. Changes create Moments. The graph is canonical.

3. **Agents receive context from graph** — Agents get triggered with hot Narratives in a Space. They work based on what's relevant. Narratives can be specific when needed ("fix bug X"). Emergence from physics, not hardcoded orchestration.

4. **Same engine, multiple clients** — mind engine serves any project that needs graph-based orchestration. Physics is universal. Content is per-client.

5. **All actors generate energy** — Every actor (human + agents) generates energy each tick based on proximity to their Space. Human creates moments/narratives like everyone else. No special pump — same rules for all.

6. **Memory through strength** — Energy is fleeting (current attention). Strength accumulates (what mattered). Cold links retain strength for recall. Nothing truly forgotten, just dormant.

7. **Many agents, emergent differentiation** — 6+ agents minimum. No specialized system prompts. Differentiation emerges naturally from memories, beliefs, links accumulated through work. We see who gets activated.

8. **World runs continuously** — World runner ticks at x1/x2/x3 speeds like the game. Not event-driven. The world is alive.

## NON-OBJECTIVES

- **Task queues** — No explicit todo lists. Narratives with type=goal + energy = implicit tasks.
- **Agent specialization by design** — Differentiation emerges from graph state, not hardcoded roles.
- **Doc preservation** — Docs can be regenerated from graph. Markdown files are views.
- **External integrations first** — GitHub, Slack, etc. come later. Core loop works with graph + human + agents.
- **Multi-human (for now)** — Single human pump. Team support comes later.

## TRADEOFFS (canonical decisions)

- When **emergence** conflicts with **predictability**, choose emergence. Let the graph surprise us.
- When **simplicity** conflicts with **features**, choose simplicity. Add only when pain is clear.
- We accept **many agents** over one to let specialization emerge. Coordination handled by graph physics.
- We accept **continuous ticks** over event-driven. World stays alive.
- When **doc structure** conflicts with **graph structure**, graph wins. Docs adapt to serve the graph.
- **Narrative completion** follows physics — energy decays, goal becomes dormant. No explicit close needed.

## SUCCESS SIGNALS (observable)

- Agent gets triggered and produces useful work without explicit instruction — just hot context.
- Focus on area → related Narratives surface → agents work on them → progress happens.
- Week-old work (cold, high strength) resurfaces when someone revisits that Space.
- New project bootstraps by ingesting its docs into Narratives, immediately usable.
- Doctor operates through graph queries, not file parsing.
- 6 agents develop distinct "personalities" through accumulated graph state.

## OPEN QUESTIONS

- **Space granularity:** One per module? Per objective? Per feature?
- **Agent count:** Start with 6, but dynamic spawning later?
- **Moment retention:** How many Moments stay in context? Time-based? Count-based? Energy-based?
