## STATUS
===============================================================================

Legacy algorithm outline for the pre-Moment-Graph Scene Memory design. The
current canonical flow lives in `MomentProcessor` and the Moment Graph docs.

===============================================================================
## LEGACY ALGORITHM OUTLINE
===============================================================================

1. **Expand names** using `{place}_{day}_{time}` prefixes, suffixing duplicates.
2. **Create Moment nodes** for narration lines, hints, and player actions.
3. **Store scene context** and link it to present characters and moments.
4. **Create narratives** from mutations, adding `FROM` links to source moments.
5. **Create beliefs** for characters present when narratives are created.
6. **Append transcript** entries for every displayed line/action.

===============================================================================
## OVERVIEW
===============================================================================

This legacy algorithm captures how the pre-Moment-Graph Scene Memory pipeline
turned narration and player actions into Moment records, linked them to scene
context, and persisted a transcript for replay. It is retained for historical
traceability while the canonical flow now lives in `MomentProcessor` and the
Moment Graph docs.

The flow normalizes identifiers, records events as moments, derives narrative
and belief edges from mutations, and appends player-visible text to the
transcript log. These steps mirror the original intent without redefining the
current canonical implementation.

===============================================================================
## DATA STRUCTURES
===============================================================================

### Scene Context (legacy)

```
Legacy container that grouped Moments, present characters, and place/time
metadata before the Moment Graph became the canonical store. This structure
anchored name expansion and ensured moment links referenced a stable scene.
```

### Moment Record (legacy)

```
Event record for narration, hint, or action; stored as a graph node with links
to scene context, speaker, and downstream narrative/belief nodes. The record
acted as the canonical anchor for transcripts and narrative derivation.
```

### Transcript Entry

```
Append-only line with text, speaker, and timestamp identifiers for audit and
playback; persisted in transcript.json for the scene/session. Entries were
stored in order and referenced the originating Moment record.
```

===============================================================================
## ALGORITHM: process_scene_memory (legacy)
===============================================================================

### Step 1: Normalize identifiers

Legacy pipeline expanded short names with `{place}_{day}_{time}` prefixes and
tracked duplicates to keep node identities unique across repeated scenes. The
alias map preserved short-form display while keeping graph IDs explicit.

### Step 2: Emit Moment nodes

For each narration line, hint, or player action, create a Moment node and link
it to the scene context plus any present character nodes. This ensures the
record is queryable by both context and participant.

### Step 3: Derive narratives and beliefs

When mutations occur, create Narrative nodes and `FROM` edges to source Moments,
then attach Belief nodes for each present character who witnessed the change.
This modeled inferred knowledge without extra narrator steps.

### Step 4: Append transcript

Persist every displayed line/action into the append-only transcript log so the
session can be reconstructed or replayed verbatim, preserving ordering and
linking each entry back to the originating Moment.

===============================================================================
## KEY DECISIONS
===============================================================================

### D1: Unique naming strategy

```
IF short_name already exists in the scene context:
    append a numeric suffix and store an alias mapping for retrieval
ELSE:
    prefix with {place}_{day}_{time} to keep global uniqueness
```

### D2: Narrative creation trigger

```
IF a mutation event is recorded:
    create Narrative and link it back to the Moment via FROM edges
ELSE:
    skip Narrative creation and only log the Moment
```

===============================================================================
## DATA FLOW
===============================================================================

```
Narration/Action line
    ↓
Name expansion + moment creation
    ↓
Optional narrative/belief derivation
    ↓
Transcript append + graph persistence
```

===============================================================================
## COMPLEXITY
===============================================================================

**Time:** O(N + M) — N lines processed, M related graph links per line, plus
name-expansion scans across the local scene alias registry.

**Space:** O(N) — transcript entries plus per-line Moment nodes and temporary
alias mappings for name expansion.

**Bottlenecks:**
- Graph writes for dense scenes with many present characters.
- Transcript flush latency when large batches are appended at once.

===============================================================================
## HELPER FUNCTIONS
===============================================================================

### `expand_scene_name()`

**Purpose:** Generate globally unique identifiers from short names.

**Logic:** Prefixes with `{place}_{day}_{time}` and adds numeric suffixes on
collisions tracked in the current scene context, while storing an alias for
display and lookup.

### `append_transcript_entry()`

**Purpose:** Persist the rendered line/action into the transcript log.

**Logic:** Writes an append-only record with speaker, timestamp, text, and a
pointer to the originating Moment for later reconstruction.

## MARKERS
===============================================================================

<!-- @mind:todo Clarify whether any legacy name-expansion rules still influence canonical -->
      Moment Graph identifiers or whether they are fully retired.
<!-- @mind:todo Decide if transcript append should remain synchronous or move to a batched -->
      async flush to reduce write latency.
<!-- @mind:proposition Map legacy Scene Context fields into explicit Moment Graph metadata for -->
  historical migrations.
<!-- @mind:escalation Which pieces of the legacy belief-creation rules survived into the -->
  current `MomentProcessor` logic, if any?
