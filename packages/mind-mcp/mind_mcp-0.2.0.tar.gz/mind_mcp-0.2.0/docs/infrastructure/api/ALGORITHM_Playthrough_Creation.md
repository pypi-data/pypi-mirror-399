This document remains as a legacy alias so older references continue to resolve, but the canonical description of the API algorithm—especially the playthrough creation flow—lives in `ALGORITHM_Api.md`.

For ongoing maintenance, read `docs/infrastructure/api/ALGORITHM_Api.md` and treat this page as a redirect that points to the consolidated explanation there.
