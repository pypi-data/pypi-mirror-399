## INVARIANTS

### INV-1: Required Fields Exist

Each moment must include id, text, type, and status fields. The canonical
schema lives in `docs/schema/SCHEMA_Moments.md`.

### INV-2: Status Is Valid

Status must be one of the allowed lifecycle states (possible, active, spoken).

### INV-3: Links Resolve

Links to place, speaker, narrative, and other moment references must point to
existing nodes.

## VERIFICATION NOTES

These invariants are not enforced in this module yet. Validation currently
happens through schema checks and downstream systems (canon, memory, physics).
