## OVERVIEW

The moment graph algorithm is not implemented yet. This document captures the
intended flow so future implementation aligns with the schema contract.

---

## TARGET FLOW

1. **Create moment node** with required properties (id, text, type, status).
2. **Attach contextual links** to place, speaker, and narrative sources.
3. **Promote status** from possible to active when readiness conditions are met.
4. **Record as spoken** once surfaced to the player or narrator.
5. **Archive or decay** moments based on weight/energy rules in the physics
   layer.

---

## DATA SOURCES

- `docs/schema/SCHEMA_Moments.md` defines fields and link types.
- Canon holder logic queries moment readiness and recording.
- Scene memory ingests moments as part of transcript persistence.
