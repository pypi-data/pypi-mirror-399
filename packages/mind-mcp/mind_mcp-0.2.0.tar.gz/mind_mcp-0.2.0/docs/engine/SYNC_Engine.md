## CURRENT STATE

Engine-level docs define runtime ownership boundaries and tie submodules together. Membrane modulation now includes per-place scoping in `docs/mind/`.

## TODO

<!-- @mind:todo Expand engine runtime flows with concrete sequences once submodule behavior stabilizes. -->
<!-- @mind:todo Docs updated, implementation needs: membrane modulation hook and supporting chain docs. -->
