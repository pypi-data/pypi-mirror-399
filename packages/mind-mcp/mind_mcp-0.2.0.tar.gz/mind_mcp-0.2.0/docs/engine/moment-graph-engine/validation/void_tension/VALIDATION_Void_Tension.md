## BEHAVIORS GUARANTEED

| Behavior ID | Behavior | Why This Validation Matters |
|-------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| B1 | Void created only after silence threshold | Avoids premature void surfacing |
| B2 | Void surfaces only when player-linked | Keeps void local to player |
| B3 | Cooldown/coalescing enforced | Prevents void spam |

---

## INVARIANTS

### VVOID1: Void Created Only After Silence Threshold

```
Void moments may be created only after a silence-duration threshold is exceeded.
```

### VVOID2: Void Requires Player Link to Surface

```
Void moments cannot surface unless linked into player neighborhood.
```

### VVOID3: Cooldown and Coalescing Enforced

```
At most one void per cooldown window; repeated inputs coalesce.
```

---

## PROPERTIES

### PVOID1: Locality

```
Void moments never surface outside player neighborhood.
```

---

## ERROR CONDITIONS

### EVOID1: Void Spam

```
WHEN:    multiple void nodes are created within cooldown window
THEN:    error
SYMPTOM: pacing collapse
```

## HEALTH COVERAGE

| Invariant | Signal | Status |

| VVOID1 | silence_threshold_hits | ⚠ NOT YET VERIFIED |
| VVOID2 | void_surface_without_link | ⚠ NOT YET VERIFIED |
| VVOID3 | void_cooldown_violations | ⚠ NOT YET VERIFIED |
