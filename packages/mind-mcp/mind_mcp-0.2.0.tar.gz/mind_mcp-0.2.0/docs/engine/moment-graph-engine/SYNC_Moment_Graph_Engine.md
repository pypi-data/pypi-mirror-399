## MATURITY

**What's canonical (v1):**
- Traversal, query, and surfacing helpers implemented in `runtime/moment_graph/`.
- Hot-path goal of sub-50ms graph operations with no LLM calls.

**What's still being designed:**
- Formal validation invariants for traversal/surfacing.
- Integration performance benchmarks and thresholds.

**What's proposed (v2+):**
- Expanded surface heuristics and richer transition strategies.

---

## CURRENT STATE

Moment graph traversal, query, and surfacing logic lives in `runtime/moment_graph/`
with explicit click/wait transitions, weight updates, and surfacing thresholds.
The module relies on physics graph ops/queries and is treated as a hot path.

---

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

**Your likely VIEW:** VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code

**Where I stopped:** Documentation only; no code changes beyond DOCS reference.

**What you need to understand:** This module is the runtime traversal/surfacing
engine; schema and contract docs live in `docs/runtime/moments/`.

**Watch out for:** Performance expectations ("<50ms") in docstrings are
assumptions; validate against real graph benchmarks before tightening.

## TODO

### Doc/Impl Drift

<!-- @mind:todo Document additional invariants if traversal logic changes. -->

### Tests to Run

```bash
pytest mind/tests/test_moment_graph.py -v
pytest mind/tests/test_e2e_moment_graph.py -v -s
```

## CONFLICTS

### DECISION: moment graph module mapping drift
- Conflict: `docs/runtime/moment-graph-mind/SYNC_Moment_Graph_Engine.md` claims
  the module is mapped in `modules.yaml`, but the manifest currently only lists
  `engine_models`.
- Resolution: Leave `modules.yaml` unchanged in this repair to keep scope on the
  traversal helper verification; record the drift for follow-up.
- Reasoning: The repair target is incomplete traversal helpers, and updating
  module mapping would be a separate maintenance change.
- Updated: `docs/runtime/moment-graph-mind/SYNC_Moment_Graph_Engine.md`

## Agent Observations

### Remarks
- Repair task identified incomplete functions, but the current
  `runtime/moment_graph/queries.py` implementations are already in place.

### Suggestions
- None.

### Propositions
- None.
