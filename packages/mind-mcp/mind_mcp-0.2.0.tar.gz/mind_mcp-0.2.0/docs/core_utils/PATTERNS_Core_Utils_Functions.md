## WHY THIS SHAPE

This module exists to house common, reusable utility functions that are not specific to any particular domain or subsystem within the `mind` framework. The goal is to avoid duplication of basic functionalities across different modules.

---

## SCOPE

**In scope:**
- Generic helper functions (e.g., path manipulation, string processing).
- Constants used across multiple modules.

**Out of scope:**
- Domain-specific utilities (e.g., `doctor_files` for doctor-related file operations).
- Complex algorithms or business logic.

---

## PRINCIPLES

- **Reusability:** Functions should be generic enough to be used in various contexts.
- **Simplicity:** Functions should be small, focused, and easy to understand.
- **No external dependencies:** Core utilities should have minimal or no external library dependencies to keep the module lightweight.

---

## DATA

This module primarily operates on basic Python data types (strings, paths, lists) and does not manage complex data structures itself.

---

## DEPENDENCIES

This module has no internal `mind` dependencies, but may rely on standard Python library modules.

---

## INSPIRATIONS

Standard Python `os.path` and `shutil` modules.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION REFERENCES

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `runtime/core_utils.py` | Canonical location for utility helpers; used by CLI commands, health checks, and other modules for path resolution, doc discovery, and file operations. |
