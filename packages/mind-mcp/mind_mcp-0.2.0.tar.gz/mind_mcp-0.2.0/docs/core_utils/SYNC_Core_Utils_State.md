## MATURITY

**What's canonical (v1):**
- `core_utils.py` provides common helper functions.
- Integration across various `mind` modules for basic file and path operations.

**What's still being designed:**
- No pending design work.

**What's proposed (v2+):**
- Expansion of utility categories (e.g., string formatting, data conversion) based on recurring needs.

---

## CURRENT STATE

`core_utils.py` has been renamed from `utils.py` and its imports updated across the codebase. It currently provides basic utilities for file paths, ignored extensions, and YAML parsing detection. The documentation chain now covers behaviors, algorithms, validation, implementation, and health, and the DOCS reference in `core_utils.py` points to the core_utils PATTERNS doc.

---

## IN PROGRESS

- No active development.

---

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-20: Pending external implementation references

- **What:** Replaced stub file paths with pending import notes in implementation docs.
- **Why:** Remove broken impl links until upstream code is imported.

### 2025-12-20: Renamed `utils.py` to `core_utils.py` and updated imports
- **What:** The `utils.py` file was renamed to `core_utils.py` to provide a more descriptive name and prevent conflicts with generic `utils` imports.
- **Why:** To adhere to project naming conventions and improve clarity. All internal imports have been updated.
- **Impact:** Ensures consistent naming and better maintainability.

### 2025-12-20: Completed core_utils documentation chain
- **What:** Added BEHAVIORS, ALGORITHM, VALIDATION, IMPLEMENTATION, and HEALTH docs and wired CHAIN links.
- **Why:** Resolve the INCOMPLETE_CHAIN warning for `docs/core_utils`.
- **Impact:** Module now has a full documentation chain and code links to the correct PATTERNS doc.

## KNOWN ISSUES

- None.

---

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

**Likely VIEW for continuing:** `VIEW_Extend_Add_Features_To_Existing.md` if expanding utilities.

**Current focus:** Ensure all modules correctly import `core_utils`.

**Key context:** The module is stable; new functions should align with principles of reusability and simplicity.

**Watch out for:** Avoid adding domain-specific logic to this module.

---

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

**Executive summary:** The core utility module has been renamed to `core_utils.py` and is fully integrated. All known references are updated.

**Decisions made recently:** Renamed `utils.py` to `core_utils.py` for improved clarity and adherence to naming conventions.

**Needs your input:** None.

**Concerns:** None.

---

## TODO

<!-- @mind:todo Keep utility scope limited to generic helpers. -->
<!-- @mind:todo Add automated tests for core_utils utilities. -->

---

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

**Project momentum:** Good. Naming conventions are being actively addressed.

**Architectural concerns:** None specific to `core_utils`.

**Opportunities noticed:** Could potentially extract more common logic from other modules into `core_utils` in the future.

| Code | `runtime/core_utils.py` |
| PATTERNS | `docs/core_utils/PATTERNS_Core_Utils_Functions.md` |

## GAPS

- Completed: Added BEHAVIORS, ALGORITHM, VALIDATION, IMPLEMENTATION, and HEALTH docs plus CHAIN links.
- Remaining: Resolve duplicate algorithm doc filenames (`docs/core_utils/ALGORITHM_Core_Utils_Template_Path_And_Module_Discovery.md` vs `docs/core_utils/ALGORITHM_Template_Path_Resolution_And_Doc_Discovery.md`) and remove the unused version.
- Remaining: Run `mind validate` and commit once the duplicate doc decision is made.
- Blocker: Unexpected new algorithm doc appeared during the repair; need guidance on which version to keep.
