## PRIMARY OBJECTIVES (ranked)
1. Tools correctness — preserve core invariants.
2. Tools clarity — keep observable outputs legible.
3. Tools performance — stay within intended budgets.

## NON-OBJECTIVES
- Automatic correction or mutation of canon state.
- Full historical trace of all internal events.

## TRADEOFFS (canonical decisions)
- Prefer correctness over speed if they conflict.
- Prefer clarity over completeness when outputs are user-facing.

## SUCCESS SIGNALS (observable)
- No critical validation failures in this module.
- Health signals remain within expected thresholds.
