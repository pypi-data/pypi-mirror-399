    This abstract class provides the foundation for resource-specific query builders.
    It implements the immutable pattern where each method call returns a new instance,
    allowing queries to be safely composed and reused.

    The immutable pattern enables powerful query composition:
        ```python
        # Create a base query that can be reused
        base = client.player.query().country("US")

        # Each derivation creates a new instance
        wa_players = base.state("WA").limit(25).get()
        or_players = base.state("OR").limit(25).get()

        # The base query is unchanged and can be reused again
        ca_players = base.state("CA").limit(25).get()
        ```
