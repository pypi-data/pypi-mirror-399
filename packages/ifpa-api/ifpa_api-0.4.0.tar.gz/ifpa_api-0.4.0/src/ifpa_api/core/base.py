"""Base classes and mixins for IFPA API client architecture.

This module provides the foundational base classes and mixins that eliminate
code duplication across resource clients, context managers, and query builders.

The architecture is built on three key abstractions:

1. BaseResourceContext: Base for resource-specific context managers (e.g., _PlayerContext)
2. BaseResourceClient: Base for resource client classes (e.g., PlayerClient)
3. Mixins: Reusable behavior for query builders (LocationFiltersMixin, PaginationMixin)

These abstractions enable the callable pattern and fluent query builder interfaces
while maintaining type safety and minimizing code duplication.

    This base class provides common initialization for context managers
    that handle operations on a specific resource instance (e.g., a specific player,
    director, or tournament).

    Context managers are returned by calling resource clients with a resource ID,
    enabling the fluent callable pattern:
        ```python
        player = client.player(12345).details()
        director = client.director(1533).details()

    or int | str depending on the specific resource requirements.

        _http: The HTTP client instance for making API requests
        _resource_id: The unique identifier for the resource instance

    Type annotations for _params and _clone are provided as class-level declarations
