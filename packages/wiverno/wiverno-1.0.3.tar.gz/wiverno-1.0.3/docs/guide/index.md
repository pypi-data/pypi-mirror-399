## Philosophy

Wiverno is designed with the following principles in mind:

### Simplicity First

Wiverno aims to be easy to learn and use. The API is intentionally small and focused on the essentials.

```python
# Simple routing
app = Wiverno()

@app.get("/")
def index(request):
    return "Hello, World!"

@app.get("/about")
def about(request):
    return "About"
```

### Explicit Over Implicit

Wiverno prefers explicit configuration over magic. You always know what's happening:

```python
# Explicit status codes and content
def view(request):
    return "Hello, World!"
```

### Flexibility

Wiverno doesn't force you into a specific way of doing things. Use what you need, ignore what you don't:

```python
# Function-based views
def simple_view(request):
    return "Simple"

# Or class-based views
class ComplexView(BaseView):
    def get(self, request):
        return "Complex"
```
