# Updating an Objective

See [format.md](format.md) for:

- **Action Comment Template** - What to include in update comments
- **When to Update** - Triggers for updating vs waiting
- **Update Examples** - Real examples of the two-step workflow

## Quick Summary

Updates have two steps that always happen together:

1. **Post action comment** - Captures what happened and lessons learned
2. **Update issue body** - Reflects new roadmap state

Comment first (captures the moment), then body (reflects new state).
