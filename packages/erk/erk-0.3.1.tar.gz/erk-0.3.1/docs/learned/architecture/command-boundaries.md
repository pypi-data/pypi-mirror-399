# Agent Command vs CLI Command Boundaries

## Overview

Erk has two types of commands:

1. **Agent commands** (`.claude/commands/`) - Markdown files executed by Claude Code
2. **CLI commands** (`src/erk/cli/`) - Python Click commands

This document clarifies when to use each.

## Use Agent Commands When

The operation requires:

- **Natural language analysis** - Categorizing, summarizing, understanding intent
- **Code generation** - Writing new code based on context
- **Documentation extraction** - Identifying gaps, generating suggestions
- **Multi-step reasoning** - Complex decision trees based on context
- **Codebase exploration** - Understanding patterns, finding related code

Examples:

- `/erk:create-extraction-plan` - Analyzes sessions for documentation gaps
- `/erk:plan-implement` - Executes implementation plans from `.impl/` folder

## Use CLI Commands When

The operation is:

- **Deterministic** - Same input always produces same output
- **Data transformation** - Parsing, formatting, converting
- **External tool orchestration** - Git, GitHub CLI, Graphite
- **File system operations** - Creating, moving, deleting files
- **State management** - Tracking worktrees, branches, issues

Examples:

- `erk pr land` - Merges PR, deletes worktree (deterministic git operations)
- `erk wt create` - Creates worktree (git operations)
- `erk exec create-extraction-plan` - Creates GitHub issue (API call)

## Hybrid Pattern: CLI Spawning Agent

When a CLI command needs AI capabilities:

1. CLI handles prerequisites and validation (Python)
2. CLI spawns `claude --print /agent-command` for AI work
3. CLI handles results and cleanup (Python)

Example: `erk pr land` could spawn `/erk:land-extraction` for AI-based session analysis, then continue with deterministic cleanup.

## Decision Tree

```
Does operation require understanding/generating natural language?
├─ Yes → Agent command
└─ No → Does it require reasoning about code semantics?
         ├─ Yes → Agent command
         └─ No → CLI command (may spawn agent if needed)
```
