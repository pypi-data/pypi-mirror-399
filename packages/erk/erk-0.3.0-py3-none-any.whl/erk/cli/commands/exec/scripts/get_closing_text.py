"""Get closing text for PR body based on .impl/issue.json reference.

This command reads the .impl/issue.json file to determine if there's an
associated GitHub issue that should be closed when the PR merges.

Usage:
    erk exec get-closing-text

Output:
    Plain text "Closes #N" if issue reference exists
    Empty output if no issue reference

Exit Codes:
    0: Always (whether issue reference exists or not)

Examples:
    $ erk exec get-closing-text
    Closes #776

    $ erk exec get-closing-text  # No .impl/issue.json
    (no output)
