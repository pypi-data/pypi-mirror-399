# Protobunny

> [!WARNING]
> The project is in early development.


Protobunny is the open-source evolution of [AM-Flow](https://am-flow.com)'s internal messaging library. 
While the original was purpose-built for RabbitMQ, this version has been completely re-engineered to provide a unified, 
type-safe interface for several message brokers, including Redis, NATS, and MQTT.

It simplifies messaging for asynchronous message handling by providing:

* A clean “message-first” API by using your protobuf definitions
* Message publishing/subscribing with typed topics
* Supports "task-like" queues (shared/competing consumers) vs. broadcast subscriptions
* Generate and consume `Result` messages (success/failure + optional return payload)
* Transparent messages serialization/deserialization
* Transparently serialize/deserialize custom "JSON-like" payload fields (numpy-friendly)
* Support async and sync contexts

Supported backends in the current version are:

- RabbitMQ
- Redis
- NATS
- Mosquitto
- Python "backend" with Queue/asyncio.Queue for local in-processing testing


> [!NOTE]
> Protobunny handles backend-specific logic internally to provide a consistent experience and a lean interface.
> Direct access to the internal NATS or Redis clients is intentionally restricted.
> If your project depends on specialized backend parameters not covered by our API, you may find the abstraction too restrictive.


## Minimal requirements

- Python >= 3.10 <=3.13
- Core Dependencies: betterproto 2.0.0b7, grpcio-tools>=1.62.0
- Backend Drivers (Optional based on your usage):
  - NATS: nats-py (Requires NATS Server v2.10+ for full JetStream support).
  - Redis: redis (Requires Redis Server v6.2+ for Stream support).
  - RabbitMQ: aio-pika
  - Mosquitto: aiomqtt


## Project scope

Protobunny is designed for teams who use messaging to coordinate work between microservices or different python processes and want:

- A small API surface, easy to learn and use, both async and sync
- Typed messaging with protobuf messages as payloads
- Supports various backends by simple configuration: RabbitMQ, Redis, Mosquitto, local in-process queues
- Consistent topic naming and routing
- Builtin task queue semantics and result messages
- Transparent handling of JSON-like payload fields as plain dictionaries/lists
- Optional validation of required fields
- Builtin logging service

## Why Protobunny?

While there are many messaging libraries for Python, Protobunny is built specifically for teams that treat **Protobuf as the single source of truth**.

* **Type-Safe by Design**: Built natively for `protobuf/betterproto`.
* **Semantic Routing**: Zero-config infrastructure. Protobunny uses your Protobuf package structure to decide if a message should be broadcast (Pub/Sub) or queued (Producer/Consumer).
* **Backend Agnostic**: You can choose between RabbitMQ, Redis, NATS, and Mosquitto. Python for local testing.
* **Sync & Async**: Support for both `asyncio` and traditional synchronous workloads.
* **Battle-Tested**: Derived from internal libraries used in production systems at AM-Flow.
