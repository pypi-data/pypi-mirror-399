"""Optimus-DL: A modular, high-performance framework for training Large Language Models.

Optimus-DL is a research framework built on PyTorch that provides:

- Modular "Recipe" architecture for clean separation of concerns
- Hydra-based configuration management
- Universal metrics system with distributed aggregation
- Modern PyTorch features (AMP, FSDP2, Tensor Parallelism, torch.compile)
- Efficient kernels via Liger-Kernel integration
- Registry system for easy component swapping

Example:
    Basic training:

    ```python
    from optimus_dl.core.registry import build
    from optimus_dl.recipe.train.config import TrainConfig

    config = TrainConfig(...)
    recipe = build("train_recipe", config)
    recipe.run()
    ```
