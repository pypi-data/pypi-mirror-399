""" Standard plug-in to take advantage of pylint or PyDev annotations.

OxNJAC can detect some things that PyLint and PyDev will complain about too,
and sometimes it's a false alarm, so people add disable markers into their
source code. OxNJAC does it itself.

This tries to parse the code for these markers and uses hooks to prevent OxNJAC
from warning about things, disabled to PyLint or Eclipse. The idea is that we
won't have another mechanism for OxNJAC, but use existing ones instead.

The code for this is very incomplete, barely good enough to cover OxNJAC's own
usage of PyLint markers. PyDev is still largely to be started. You are welcome
to grow both.
