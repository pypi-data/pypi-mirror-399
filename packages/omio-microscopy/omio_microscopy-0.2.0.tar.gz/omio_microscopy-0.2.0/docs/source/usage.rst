Usage
========

In this section, we provide detailed usage examples and explanations
of the core functions and features of OMIO. Each subsection focuses on a
specific aspect of the library, guiding users through common workflows and
use cases.

You can use the code examples provided here as a starting point for your own
projects. All code snippets are also available in the example script
``usage_example_interactive.py``located in the ``additional_scripts`` folder of the
OMIO repository. That script is meant to be run interactively, e.g., using
VS Code's interactive window features.
