# ai-pose-generator

The `ai-pose-generator` package provides a streamlined interface for interacting with and demonstrating the capabilities of the AI pose generation service. It offers a simplified way to create various poses using the Supermaker AI platform.

## Installation

To install the `ai-pose-generator` package, use pip:
bash
pip install ai-pose-generator

## Basic Usage

Here are some examples demonstrating how to use the `ai-pose-generator` package:

**1. Generating a Basic Standing Pose:**

This example demonstrates how to generate a simple standing pose with default parameters.
python
from ai_pose_generator import PoseGenerator

pose_gen = PoseGenerator()
image_path = pose_gen.generate_pose(pose_type="standing")

print(f"Generated image saved to: {image_path}")

**2. Generating a Sitting Pose with Custom Parameters:**

This example shows how to customize the generated pose, specifying a sitting position and adjusting other parameters.
python
from ai_pose_generator import PoseGenerator

pose_gen = PoseGenerator()
image_path = pose_gen.generate_pose(
    pose_type="sitting",
    style="realistic",
    background_color="white"
)

print(f"Generated image saved to: {image_path}")

**3. Generating a Yoga Pose:**

This example demonstrates generating a more complex pose, such as a yoga pose, and saving the resulting image.
python
from ai_pose_generator import PoseGenerator

pose_gen = PoseGenerator()
image_path = pose_gen.generate_pose(pose_type="yoga", yoga_pose="tree_pose")

print(f"Generated image saved to: {image_path}")

**4. Generating a Running Pose with a Specific Background:**

This example shows how to specify a particular background for the generated pose.
python
from ai_pose_generator import PoseGenerator

pose_gen = PoseGenerator()
image_path = pose_gen.generate_pose(
    pose_type="running",
    background_image="path/to/your/background.jpg"
)

print(f"Generated image saved to: {image_path}")

**5. Generating a Custom Pose Description:**

This example utilizes a textual description to generate a pose. This requires a more advanced integration with Supermaker AI's API, which is simplified by this package.
python
from ai_pose_generator import PoseGenerator

pose_gen = PoseGenerator()
image_path = pose_gen.generate_pose(
    pose_description="A person meditating in a peaceful garden."
)

print(f"Generated image saved to: {image_path}")

## Features

*   **Simplified Pose Generation:** Easily generate various poses with a single function call.
*   **Pose Type Selection:** Choose from a range of predefined pose types like standing, sitting, yoga, and running.
*   **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust style, background color, and other parameters to fine-tune the generated pose.
*   **Background Image Integration:** Incorporate custom background images into the generated poses.
*   **Descriptive Pose Generation:** Generate poses based on textual descriptions.
*   **Seamless Supermaker AI Integration:** Designed to work smoothly with the Supermaker AI platform.
