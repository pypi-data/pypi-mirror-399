# Document Processing Profile
# Optimized for document analysis, OCR, and content extraction tasks
# This profile demonstrates how to override default framework settings for specific use cases

# Workflow Configuration
workflow:
  agent_type: "orchestrator"  # Use orchestrator for multi-step document processing
  execution_mode: "batch"     # Support batch document processing
  stateful: false             # Stateless for batch processing of multiple documents

# Enabled MCP servers for this profile
enabled_servers:
  - ocr
  - vision

# LLM overrides for document processing
llm:
  model: "gpt-4-turbo"
  temperature: 0.3  # Lower temperature for more deterministic output
  max_tokens: 8192  # Larger context for long documents

# Agent overrides (if using base Agent instead of Orchestrator)

    You are a document analysis assistant with access to OCR and vision tools.
    Extract and analyze information from documents accurately and efficiently.
  mcp_servers:
    - ocr
    - vision
  max_mcp_calls: 10
  mcp_timeout: 60  # Longer timeout for document processing

# Orchestrator overrides for complex document workflows
orchestrator:

    You are a document analysis orchestrator specialized in extracting, analyzing, and processing
    information from various document formats.

    Available capabilities:
    - OCR: Extract text from images and PDFs
    - Vision: Analyze document structure, detect tables, charts, and visual elements

    Your workflow:
    1. Analyze the document type and structure
    2. Plan extraction strategy (OCR for text, vision for layout/tables)
    3. Execute extraction with appropriate tools
    4. Validate and structure the extracted data
    5. Provide comprehensive analysis and summary

    Prioritize accuracy and completeness. For complex documents, use both OCR and vision
    to cross-validate results and capture all information.
