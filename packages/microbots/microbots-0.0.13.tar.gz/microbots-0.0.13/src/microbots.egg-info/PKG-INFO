# 🤖 Microbots

MicroBots is a lightweight, extensible AI agent for code comprehension and controlled file edits. It integrates cleanly
into automation pipelines, mounting a target directory with explicit read-only or read/write modes so LLMs can safely
inspect, refactor, or generate files with least‑privilege access.


```py
from microbots import WritingBot

myWritingBot = WritingBot(
    model="azure-openai/my-gpt5", # model format : <provider/deployment_model_name>
    folder_to_mount=str("myReactApp"),
)

data = myWritingBot.run("""when doing npm run build, I get an error.
Fix the error and make sure the build is successful.""", timeout_in_seconds=600)
print(data.results)
```

## ⚠️ Project Status: Under Fast Development

This project is currently **under active development**. Features, APIs, and internal structures are subject to change across versions without notice, and unexpected behavior may occur. Please **use with caution** in production environments.

## 🚀 How to install

### Pre-requisites

- Docker
- AI LLM Provider and API Key

### Install Microbots

```bash
pip install microbots
```


## ✨LLM Support

Azure OpenAI Models - Add the below environment variables in a `.env` file in the root of your application

```env
OPEN_AI_END_POINT=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
OPEN_AI_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

## 🤖 Bots & Usage Examples

Pre-requisite for the below example code of Bots:
From the root of your application, Create a folder called  `code` inside which clone the repo `https://github.com/swe-agent/test-repo/`. Now run the code


### 📖 ReadingBot


```py
from microbots import ReadingBot

myBot = ReadingBot(
    model="azure-openai/my-gpt5",
    folder_to_mount="code"
)

runResult = myBot.run("When I am running missing_colon.py I am getting SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Find the error and explain me what is the error", timeout_in_seconds=600)
print(runResult)

```

The `ReadingBot` will read the files inside `code` folder and will extract information based on specific instructions given to the bot.


### ✍️ WritingBot

Pre-requisite for the example code:
From the root the application, Create a folder called  `code` inside which clone the repo `https://github.com/swe-agent/test-repo/`. Now run the code

```py
from microbots import WritingBot

myBot = WritingBot(
    model="azure-openai/my-gpt5",
    folder_to_mount="code"
)

myBot.run("When I am running missing_colon.py I am getting SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Fix the error and make sure the code runs without any errors.", timeout_in_seconds=600)
```

The `WritingBot` will read and write the files inside `code` folder based on specific instructions given to the bot.

## ⚙️ How it works


![Overall Architecture Image](./docs/images/overall_architecture.png)

The MicroBots create a containerized environment and mount the specified directory with restricting the permissions to read-only or read/write based on Bot used. It ensures that the AI agents operate within defined boundaries which enhances security and control over code modifications as well as protecting the local environment.
