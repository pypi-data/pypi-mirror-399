import bluetooth # pybluez

# Scan Bluetooth
print("Scanning bluetooth...")

nearby_devices = bluetooth.discover_devices(
    lookup_names=True,
    lookup_class=True
)

print(f"Found {len(nearby_devices)} devices\n")

# List the Bluetooth devices with informations
for address, name, classe in nearby_devices:
    decoded = decode(classe)
    
    print(f"Name: {name}")
    print(f"Adress: {address}")
    
    print("Major Device Class: ", decoded["majorClass"])
    print("Minor Device Class: ", ", ".join(decoded["minorClass"]))
    print("Service Device Classes: ", ", ".join(decoded["serviceClass"]))
    
    print("\n")
```
