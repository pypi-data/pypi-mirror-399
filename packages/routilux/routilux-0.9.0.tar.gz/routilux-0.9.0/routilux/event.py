    """Output event for transmitting data to other routines.

    An Event represents an output point in a Routine that can transmit data
    to connected Slots in other routines. Events enable one-to-many data
    distribution: when an event is emitted, all connected slots receive
    the data simultaneously.

    Key Concepts:
        - Events are defined in routines using define_event()
        - Events are emitted using emit() or Routine.emit()
        - Events can connect to multiple slots (broadcast pattern)
        - Slots can connect to multiple events (aggregation pattern)
        - Parameter mapping can transform data during transmission

    Connection Model:
        Events support many-to-many connections:
        - One event can connect to many slots (broadcasting)
        - One slot can connect to many events (aggregation)
        - Connections are managed via Flow.connect()
        - Parameter mappings can rename parameters per connection

    Examples:
        Basic usage:
            >>> class MyRoutine(Routine):
            ...     def __init__(self):
            ...         super().__init__()
            ...         self.output = self.define_event("output", ["result"])
            ...
            ...     def __call__(self):
            ...         self.emit("output", result="success", status=200)

        Multiple connections:
            >>> # One event, multiple receivers
            >>> flow.connect(source_id, "output", target1_id, "input1")
            >>> flow.connect(source_id, "output", target2_id, "input2")
            >>> # Both targets receive data when source emits "output"

        This method transmits data to all slots connected to this event using
        a queue-based mechanism. Tasks are enqueued and executed asynchronously,
        allowing emit() to return immediately without waiting for downstream
        execution.

        Execution Mode:
            - All execution uses a unified queue-based mechanism
            - Sequential mode: max_workers=1, tasks execute one at a time
            - Concurrent mode: max_workers>1, tasks execute in parallel
            - emit() is always non-blocking and returns immediately

        Parameter Mapping:
            If a Connection has param_mapping defined (via Flow.connect()),
            parameter names are transformed before being sent to the slot.
            Unmapped parameters are passed with their original names.

        Flow Context Auto-Detection:
            If flow parameter is None, this method automatically attempts to
            get the flow from the routine's context (routine._current_flow).
            This allows simpler usage: event.emit(data="value") instead of
            event.emit(flow=my_flow, data="value").

            The flow context is automatically set by Flow.execute() and Flow.resume().

        Args:
            flow: Optional Flow object. If None, automatically attempts to get
                from routine._current_flow (set by Flow.execute()).
                Required for:
                - Finding Connection objects to apply parameter mappings
                - Recording execution history in JobState
                - Queue-based task execution
                If no flow is available, falls back to direct slot.receive() call (legacy mode).
            ``**kwargs``: Data to transmit. These keyword arguments form the
                data dictionary sent to connected slots. All values must be
                serializable if the flow uses persistence.
                Example: emit(result="success", count=42)

        Examples:
            Basic emission (automatic flow detection):
                >>> event = routine.define_event("output", ["result"])
                >>> # Inside a routine handler called by Flow.execute():
                >>> event.emit(result="data", status="ok")
                >>> # Automatically uses routine._current_flow

            Explicit flow parameter:
                >>> event.emit(flow=my_flow, result="data", status="ok")
                >>> # Explicitly specify flow (useful for testing or edge cases)

            Without flow (legacy mode):
                >>> event.emit(result="data")  # Direct call, no queue
                >>> # Only works if no flow context available
