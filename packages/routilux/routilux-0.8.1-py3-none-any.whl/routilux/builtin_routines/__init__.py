"""
Routilux built-in routines.

This package contains commonly used routines that are generic and reusable
across different business domains. Routines are organized by category:

- text_processing: Text manipulation and formatting routines
- utils: General utility routines
- data_processing: Data transformation and validation routines
- control_flow: Flow control and routing routines

All routines inherit from Routine which provides common utilities like
_extract_input_data() and _track_operation().
