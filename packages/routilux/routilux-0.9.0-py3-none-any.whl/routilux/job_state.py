    JobState maintains comprehensive state information about flow execution,
    including routine states, execution history, pause points, and overall
    execution status. It provides a complete snapshot of workflow execution
    that can be serialized, persisted, and used for resumption.

    Key Responsibilities:
        - Status Tracking: Monitor overall flow execution status
        - Routine States: Track individual routine execution states
        - Execution History: Record all routine executions with timestamps
        - Pause Points: Support execution pausing and resumption
        - State Queries: Provide methods to query execution state

    Status Values:
        - "pending": Flow created but not yet started
        - "running": Flow execution in progress
        - "paused": Flow execution paused (can be resumed)
        - "completed": Flow execution completed successfully
        - "failed": Flow execution failed due to error
        - "cancelled": Flow execution cancelled by user

    Routine State Values:
        - "pending": Routine not yet executed
        - "running": Routine execution in progress
        - "completed": Routine executed successfully
        - "failed": Routine execution failed
        - "error_continued": Routine failed but execution continued (CONTINUE strategy)
        - "skipped": Routine was skipped (SKIP strategy)

    Examples:
        Basic usage:
            >>> job_state = flow.execute(entry_routine_id)
            >>> print(job_state.status)  # "completed" or "failed"
            >>> routine_state = job_state.get_routine_state(routine_id)

            >>> for record in history:
            ...     print(f"{record.routine_id} emitted {record.event_name}")
