              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

<!-- Not always needed, but a scope helps the user understand in a short sentance like below, why this repo exists -->
## Scope

The tool analyzes Javacores and verbose gc logs and provides some reports like cpu/gc usage, blocked threads, some tips regarding the javacores. The tool can process the following data:
* Set of Javacores from the same run. Optionally you can add verbose.gc log file
* Single Javacore

  
<!-- A more detailed Usage or detailed explaination of the repository here -->
## Installation and usage

### Installation:
The tool requires Python 3.9 or higher plus some packages - see more in [REQUIREMENTS](REQUIREMENTS.md). 
Despite it is not mandatory, it is recommended in Python to use virtual environment to manage packages.

#### Installing from pip
This is most common option which you will need in 99% of situations  

Steps:
1. Download and install Python. Usually the latest version is supported. Search for supported versions in 
[REQUIREMENTS](REQUIREMENTS.md)
2. Create and activate Virtual Environment according to [Creating virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments).
3. Run the following command:
   `pip install javacore-analyser`  
    OR
   `pip install --pre javacore-analyser` - if you want an experimental version


#### Installing from sources
This is recommended for geeks only:
1. Repeat steps 1 and 2 from above
2. Download the project files either from [Releases](https://github.com/IBM/javacore-analyser/releases) or from [main](https://github.com/IBM/javacore-analyser/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
3. Extract the code and from code directory execute
   `pip install .`

### Running the tool:

#### Running cmd application: 
1. Install application if not done yet
2. Activate your created virtual environment according to activate Virtual Environment according to [Creating virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments)
3. Run the following command from cmd:  
`javacore-analyser-batch <input-data> <generated-reports-dir>`  
or  
`python -m javacore_analyser batch <input-data> <generated-reports-dir>`  

Where `<input-data>` is one of the following:
* The directory containing javacores and optionally verbose gc
* Archive (7z, zip, tar.gz, tar.bz2) containing the same
* List of the javacores separated by `;` character. Optionally you can add `--separator` option to define your own separator.
* You can specify `--skip_boring=False` if you want drill-down pages generated for all the threads, including the ones that do not do anything interesting.
You can type the following command to obtain the help:  
`javacore-analyser-batch --help` or `python -m javacore_analyser batch --help`

#### Running web application:
1. Repeat steps 1-3 from cmd application
2. Execute the following command from cmd:  
  `javacore_analyser_web --port=5000 --reports-dir=/data/reports_dir`  
     or  
  `python -m javacore_analyser web --port=5000 --reports-dir=/data/reports_dir`  


   The first parameter set the port to use by application. If not specified, 5000 will be used.  
   The second parameter sets where the reports need to be stored. If not set, then the `reports` dir will be created in current location.  

Now you can type (http://localhost:5000/).

#### Configuring cmd and web application.
Once you run the application the first time, there is `config.ini` file created in running directory. The application 
uses this properties file to set configuration. You can modify the properties to adopt running the tool to your needs.
There is `--config_file` command line parameter which you can use if you want to change the location of configuration 
file.

### Running container image
There is a Docker/Podman container managed by one of projects developers. Use the following command 
to start it:

`podman run -it --rm --name javacore-analyser --mount type=bind,src="/local-reports-dir",target=/reports -p 5001:5000 ghcr.io/ibm/javacore-analyser:latest`

or  
`docker run -it --rm --name javacore-analyser --mount type=bind,src="/local-reports-dir",target=/reports -p 5001:5000 ghcr.io/ibm/javacore-analyser:latest`  

The `mount` option specifies where you want locally to store the reports. The reports in the container are stored in 
`/reports` directory. If you remove mount option, the application will work but the reports will not persist after 
restart.  
The application is running in the container on port 5000. By using `-p 5001:5000` option, you specify to map container 
port 5000 to port 5001 on your machine. Therefore the application will be available under `http://localhost:5001/`.

NOTE: If you get a `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/reports/wait2-debug.log'` message,
try specifying a different folder as the `src` parameter value or use the
[--volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) option instead of `--mount`. Find more on 
[Issue #140](https://github.com/IBM/javacore-analyser/issues/140#issuecomment-2757809160).


### Running collectors
There is a collector available that will gather javacores, verbose gc and some further server configuration (`ulimit`, `ps`, memory and disk usage) for Linux systems.
Perform the following steps to run the tool:
1. Download the collector from [javacoreCollector.sh](collectors/javacoreCollector.sh) to the machine where you want to gather data. 
2. Execute it with the following command:

`./javacoreCollector.sh libertyPath=/opt/ibm/liberty server=liberty_server_name` - for collecting diagnostic data from a java application running on an IBM WebSphere Liberty profile,

or

`./javacoreCollector.sh javaPid=12345 javacoresDir=/location/for/javacores` - for collecting diagnostic data from any java aplication.


You can add the 'count' and 'interval' parameters to specify the number of javacores (default: 10) and interval between each of them (defaul: 30s).

Type `./javacoreCollector.sh` to get more help.

After collection, the collector creates `javacores.tar.gz` file containing the following data:
* javacore files, 
* Verbose gc files, if found in `javacoresDir` or `libertyPath` location, 
* Ulimit settings in `ulimit.txt` file,
* output from `ps`, memory and disk usage it iteration files. This data is gathered periodically with the same interval as javacores. There is separate file created for each collection.
