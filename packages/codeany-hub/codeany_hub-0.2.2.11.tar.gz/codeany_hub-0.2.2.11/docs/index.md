# Codeany Hub Python SDK Documentation

Welcome to the developer documentation for the Codeany Hub Python SDK. This
site supplements the repository `README.md` with deeper guides, scenario-driven
recipes, and reference material for advanced customization.

## Contents

- [Getting Started](./quickstart.md) – configure environments, bootstrap clients,
  and explore synchronous vs. asynchronous entry points.
- [Authentication](./authentication.md) – deep dive into auth strategies, environment variables, and token management.
- [Retry Policies & Hooks](./retry-policies.md) – plug custom retry logic and
  instrumentation into the shared transport layer.
- [Scenario Playbooks](./scenarios.md) – end-to-end flows that combine hubs,
  competitions, submissions, and ratings.
- [Task Management](./tasks.md) – create and manage tasks, statements, and
  test data with the improved SDK.

Each page is designed to be copy/pastable in scripts or notebooks. Contributions
are welcome—tweak or extend these docs as new API capabilities land.

> **Tip:** For local docs hosting, point your static site generator (MkDocs,
> Sphinx, Docusaurus, etc.) at the `docs/` directory or export it to your team
> wiki of choice.
