"""XLA backend for Flash Attention with tiled computation.

This submodule provides an XLA-optimized implementation of Flash Attention
that achieves memory-efficient attention through tiled computation.

Key Features:
    - Memory-efficient O(N) space complexity (vs O(N^2) for standard attention)
    - Tiled forward and backward passes
    - Support for causal masking and sliding window
    - Optional dropout and attention bias
    - Segment ID support for packed sequences
    - Custom gradient implementation for numerical stability

Algorithm:
    The implementation processes attention in tiles/chunks, computing
    softmax incrementally to avoid materializing the full NxN attention matrix.
