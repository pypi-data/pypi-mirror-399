"""Pallas TPU backend for Flash Attention.

This submodule provides TPU-optimized Flash Attention using Pallas with
Mosaic backend for memory-efficient exact attention computation.

Key Features:
    - Memory-efficient O(N) computation using tiled approach
    - Custom forward and backward Pallas kernels
    - Support for causal masking and sliding window
    - Optimized for TPU Matrix Units
