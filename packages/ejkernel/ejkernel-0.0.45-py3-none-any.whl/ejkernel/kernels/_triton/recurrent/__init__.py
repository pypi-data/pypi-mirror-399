"""Triton backend for Recurrent Attention.

This submodule provides GPU-optimized recurrent linear attention using
Triton kernels for O(N) complexity sequential processing.

Key Features:
    - Linear complexity through state recurrence
    - Custom forward and backward Triton kernels
    - State caching for incremental inference
    - Support for various gating mechanisms
