"""Triton backend for Flash Attention.

This submodule provides GPU-optimized Flash Attention using Triton kernels.
Achieves O(N) memory complexity through tiled computation with online softmax.

Key Features:
    - Memory-efficient exact attention computation
    - Custom forward and backward Triton kernels
    - Support for causal masking, sliding window, and bias
    - GQA/MQA head configurations
