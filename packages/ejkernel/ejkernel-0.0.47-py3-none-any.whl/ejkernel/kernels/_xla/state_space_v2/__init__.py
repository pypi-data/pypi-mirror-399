"""XLA backend for SSM2 (Mamba2-style) selective state space.

This submodule provides XLA-optimized implementations of SSM2,
the Mamba2 selective state space model architecture.

Key characteristics:
- 1D A vector: [num_heads] (per-head scalar)
- SSM state shape: [batch, num_heads, head_dim, ssm_state_size]
- O(N) complexity through sequential processing
