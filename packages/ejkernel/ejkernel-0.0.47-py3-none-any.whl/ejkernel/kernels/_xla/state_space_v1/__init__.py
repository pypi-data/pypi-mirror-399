"""XLA backend for SSM1 (Mamba1-style) selective state space.

This submodule provides XLA-optimized implementations of SSM1,
the original Mamba selective state space model architecture.

Key characteristics:
- 2D A matrix: [intermediate_size, ssm_state_size]
- SSM state shape: [batch, intermediate_size, ssm_state_size]
- O(N) complexity through sequential processing
