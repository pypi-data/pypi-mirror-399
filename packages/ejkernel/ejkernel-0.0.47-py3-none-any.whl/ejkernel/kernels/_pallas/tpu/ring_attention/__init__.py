"""Ring Attention using Splash Attention kernels.

This module provides a ring attention implementation that distributes attention
computation across devices using a ring topology, with JAX's splash attention
kernel as the inner attention mechanism.

Features:
- Distributed ring communication via lax.ppermute
- All splash attention mask types (Causal, ChunkedCausal, Local, Full)
- Custom mask builder support
- Attention sinks (softmax_aux/sinks)
- Logits soft capping
- Full backward pass with custom VJP
