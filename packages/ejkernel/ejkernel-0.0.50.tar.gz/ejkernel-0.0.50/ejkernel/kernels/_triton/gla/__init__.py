"""Triton backend for Gated Linear Attention (GLA).

This submodule provides GPU-optimized GLA using Triton kernels with
recurrent formulation for O(N) complexity.

Key Features:
    - Linear complexity through recurrent state updates
    - Gated key-value updates for selective memory
    - Chunked computation for training efficiency
    - State caching for autoregressive generation
