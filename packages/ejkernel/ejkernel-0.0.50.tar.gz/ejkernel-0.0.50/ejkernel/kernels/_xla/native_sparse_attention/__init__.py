"""XLA backend for Native Sparse Attention.

This submodule provides XLA-optimized implementation of native sparse
attention using configurable sparsity patterns like DeepSeek NSA.

Key Features:
    - Configurable block-sparse attention patterns
    - Sliding window with compressed global tokens
    - Support for both prefill and decode phases
    - Custom VJP for efficient gradient computation
