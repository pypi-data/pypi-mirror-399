"""XLA backend for Lightning Attention.

This submodule provides XLA-optimized implementation of Lightning Attention,
a linear-complexity attention with exponential decay for fast training.

Key Features:
    - O(N) complexity with linear attention formulation
    - Configurable decay rates for temporal weighting
    - Chunked processing for efficient training
    - State persistence for incremental inference
