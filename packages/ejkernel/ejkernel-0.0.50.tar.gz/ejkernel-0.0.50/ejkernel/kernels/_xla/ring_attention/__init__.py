"""XLA backend for Ring Attention distributed attention.

This submodule provides XLA-optimized implementation of Ring Attention
for processing long sequences across multiple devices in a ring topology.

Key Features:
    - Distributed attention across multiple devices
    - Ring communication pattern for memory efficiency
    - Support for causal masking with blockwise patterns
    - Compatible with JAX's pjit for multi-device execution

Algorithm:
    Ring Attention distributes sequence chunks across devices,
    computing attention incrementally while passing key-value
    blocks around the ring to minimize memory per device.
