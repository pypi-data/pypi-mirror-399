"""Triton backend for Lightning Attention.

This submodule provides GPU-optimized Lightning Attention using Triton
kernels with layer-adaptive exponential decay.

Key Features:
    - O(N) complexity with linear attention formulation
    - Layer-dependent decay rates for varied temporal receptive fields
    - Chunked processing for efficient training
    - State persistence for incremental inference
