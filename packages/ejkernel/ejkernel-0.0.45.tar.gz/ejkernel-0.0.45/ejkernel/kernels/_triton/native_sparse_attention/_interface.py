"""Native Sparse Attention (NSA) implementation using Triton kernels.

This module implements Native Sparse Attention, a hybrid attention mechanism
that combines compressed attention over coarse-grained blocks with selective
fine-grained attention to important tokens. This approach achieves significant
computational savings while maintaining model quality.

NSA Architecture:
-----------------
NSA consists of two parallel attention pathways that are gated and combined:

1. **Compressed Attention** (g_cmp pathway):
   - Keys and values are mean-pooled into blocks (e.g., 64 tokens -> 1 block)
   - Each query attends to these compressed block representations
   - Provides global context with O(N²/B) complexity for block size B
   - Used to identify which blocks contain important information

2. **Selected Attention** (g_slc pathway):
   - Based on compressed attention scores, select top-K blocks per query
   - Perform full fine-grained attention only to selected blocks
   - Provides detailed local attention with O(N*K*B) complexity
   - Focuses computational resources on relevant regions

The final output is a gated combination:
    output = g_slc * selected_attn + g_cmp * compressed_attn

where g_slc and g_cmp are learned gating values that balance the two pathways.

Key Benefits:
-------------
1. **Adaptive sparsity**: Automatically learns which blocks are important
2. **Flexible trade-off**: Balance between global context and local detail
3. **Reduced computation**: O(N²/B + N*K*B) instead of O(N²)
4. **Maintained quality**: Selective attention focuses on relevant tokens

Example complexity for N=4096, B=64, K=16:
- Standard attention: 16M operations
- NSA: ~1M operations (16x reduction)

Implementation Details:
-----------------------
- Requires Grouped Query Attention (GQA) with group size multiple of 16
- Supports variable-length sequences via cu_seqlens
- Block indices can be pre-computed or learned via compression pathway
- Gradients flow through both compression and selection mechanisms

Example:
    >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
    >>> from ejkernel.kernels._triton.native_sparse_attention import native_sparse_attention
    >>>
    >>> batch, seq_len, num_q_heads, num_kv_heads, head_dim = 2, 2048, 32, 32, 64
    >>> q = jnp.ones((batch, seq_len, num_q_heads, head_dim))
    >>> k = jnp.ones((batch, seq_len, num_kv_heads, head_dim))
    >>> v = jnp.ones((batch, seq_len, num_kv_heads, head_dim))
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> g_cmp = jnp.ones((batch, seq_len, num_q_heads))
    >>> g_slc = jnp.ones((batch, seq_len, num_q_heads))
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> output = native_sparse_attention(
    ...     q, k, v,
    ...     g_cmp=g_cmp,
    ...     g_slc=g_slc,
    ...     block_counts=16,
    ...     block_size=64
    ... )

    NSA is a sparse attention mechanism that combines two components:
    1.  **Compressed Attention**: A coarse-grained attention over mean-pooled
        (compressed) key-value blocks. This provides a global context summary.
    2.  **Selected Attention**: A fine-grained, sparse attention where each
        query attends to a small subset of the original key-value blocks.

    The key idea is that the selection of blocks for the second component can be
    determined efficiently using the compressed representations from the first.
    The final output is a gated combination of these two components.

    Args:
        query: Query tensor of shape `(batch_size, sequence, query_heads, dimk)`.
        key: Key tensor of shape `(batch_size, sequence, kvheads, dimk)`. GQA is enforced, where the ratio
            of query heads (query_heads) to key/value heads (kvheads) must be a multiple of 16.
        value: Value tensor of shape `(batch_size, sequence, kvheads, dimv)`.
        g_cmp: Optional gate tensor for compressed attention, shape `(batch_size, sequence, query_heads)`.
            If provided, the compressed attention component is computed.
        g_slc: Optional gate tensor for selected attention, shape `(batch_size, sequence, query_heads)`.
        block_indices: Optional tensor of pre-computed block indices for selected
            attention, shape `(batch_size, sequence, kvheads, S)`. `S` is the number of selected
            blocks (`block_counts`). If `g_cmp` is provided, this argument is
            ignored, and block indices are computed dynamically via top-k
            selection over the compressed keys. If `g_cmp` is NOT provided, this
            argument is required.
        block_counts: Number of blocks to select for each query. Defaults to 16.
        block_size: The size of each attention block. Defaults to 64.
        softmax_scale: Scale factor for attention scores. Defaults to `1 / sqrt(dimk)` or `dimk**-0.5`.

            variable-length training. If provided, batch size batch_size must be 1.
