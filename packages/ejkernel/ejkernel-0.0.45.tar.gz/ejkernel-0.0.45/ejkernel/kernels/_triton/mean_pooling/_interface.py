"""Mean pooling operations using Triton kernels.

This module provides GPU-accelerated mean pooling over sequence dimensions,
commonly used in NLP tasks to aggregate token embeddings into fixed-size
representations. The implementation uses custom Triton kernels for optimal
performance on GPUs.

Mean pooling computes the average of all token embeddings in a sequence,
producing a single vector representation. This is particularly useful for:
- Sentence/document embeddings in classification tasks
- Block compression in sparse attention mechanisms
- Sequence-level representations for downstream tasks

The implementation supports:
- Standard batched sequences with uniform lengths
- Variable-length sequences via cumulative sequence lengths (cu_seqlens)
- Efficient GPU parallelization via Triton
- Full automatic differentiation support

Example:
    >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
    >>> from ejkernel.kernels._triton.mean_pooling import mean_pooling
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> batch, seq_len, hidden_dim = 4, 128, 768
    >>> x = jnp.ones((batch, seq_len, hidden_dim))
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> pooled = mean_pooling(x, chunk_size=32)
    >>> print(pooled.shape)

    Performs mean pooling over the sequence dimension using a Triton kernel.

    This function calculates the mean of token embeddings for each sequence in a
    batch. It is optimized for GPUs using a custom Triton kernel and supports
    both standard (padded) and variable-length sequences.

    Args:
        x: The input tensor of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_dim)`.
            If `cu_seqlens` is provided for variable-length inputs, the shape

            handling variable-length sequences in a packed format.

            sequences.

        embeddings for each sequence. If `cu_seqlens` is used, the batch size in
