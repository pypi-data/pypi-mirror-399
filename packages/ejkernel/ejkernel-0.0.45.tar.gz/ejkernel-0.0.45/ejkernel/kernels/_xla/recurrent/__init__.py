"""XLA backend for Recurrent Attention mechanisms.

This submodule provides XLA-optimized implementation of recurrent attention
with linear-time complexity through sequential state updates.

Key Features:
    - O(N) complexity through state recurrence
    - Chunked processing for parallel training
    - State caching for incremental inference
    - Custom VJP for gradient computation
