"""XLA backend for Grouped Matrix Multiplication.

This submodule provides XLA-optimized implementation of grouped matrix
multiplication operations for processing multiple matrix multiplications
with different sizes in a single batched operation.

Key Features:
    - Efficient batched processing of variable-size matrix multiplications
    - Support for group indices specifying which matrices to multiply
    - Optimized memory access patterns for grouped operations
