"""XLA backend for Kernel Delta Attention (DeltaNet).

This submodule provides XLA-optimized implementation of kernel delta attention,
a linear attention variant using delta rule updates for state management.

Key Features:
    - O(N) complexity through recurrent state updates
    - Delta rule for selective memory management
    - Configurable decay factors for temporal weighting
    - Support for chunked, recurrent, and single-step modes
