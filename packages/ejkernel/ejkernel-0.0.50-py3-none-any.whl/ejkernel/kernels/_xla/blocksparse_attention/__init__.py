"""XLA backend for Block Sparse Attention.

This submodule provides XLA-optimized implementation of block-sparse
attention with configurable sparsity patterns.

Key Features:
    - Block-wise sparse attention patterns
    - Configurable block sizes
    - Support for custom sparsity masks
    - Memory-efficient computation for long sequences
