"""Kernel implementations for various platforms and backends.

This module provides a unified interface to kernel implementations across
different hardware platforms (GPU, TPU) and implementation frameworks
(Triton, Pallas, XLA, CUDA).

The kernel system supports:
- Multi-platform implementations with automatic selection
- Priority-based kernel selection
- Hardware-specific optimizations
- Unified API across different backends

Submodules:
    cuda: CUDA-specific kernel implementations
    pallas: Pallas kernel implementations for TPU/GPU
    triton: Triton kernel implementations for GPU
    xla: XLA-based kernel implementations

Key Components:
    Backend: Enumeration of supported hardware backends
    Platform: Enumeration of supported implementation platforms
    kernel_registry: Central registry for kernel registration and lookup

Example:
    >>> from ejkernel.kernels import kernel_registry, Platform, Backend
    >>>
    >>> kernel = kernel_registry.get(
    ...     "flash_attention",
    ...     platform=Platform.TRITON,
    ...     backend=Backend.GPU
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> output = kernel(query, key, value)
