"""XLA backend for Gated Linear Attention (GLA).

This submodule provides XLA-optimized implementation of Gated Linear Attention,
a linear-complexity attention mechanism with learnable gates.

Key Features:
    - O(N) complexity through recurrent formulation
    - Gated key-value updates for selective memory
    - Chunked computation for training efficiency
    - State caching for autoregressive generation
