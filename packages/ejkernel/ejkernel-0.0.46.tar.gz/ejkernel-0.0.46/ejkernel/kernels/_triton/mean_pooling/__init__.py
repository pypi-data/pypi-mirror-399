"""Triton backend for Mean Pooling.

This submodule provides GPU-optimized mean pooling using Triton kernels
for efficient sequence embedding aggregation.

Key Features:
    - Sequence mean pooling with mask support
    - Efficient handling of variable-length sequences
    - Custom forward and backward Triton kernels
    - Support for packed sequence processing
