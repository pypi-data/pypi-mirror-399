![The image showcases three pages of a PDF version of "The Swift Programming Language" book. The first page displays a table of contents, listing chapters like "Welcome to Swift" and "Language Guide" with page numbers. The second page contains Swift code examples and explanations about loops, including how to use a for-in loop. The third page continues discussing while loops with a visual example of a snakes and ladders game board. The pages maintain DocC styling with black headers and highlighted code sections.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/466408bd-ff63-470e-a1fb-e84cb0b9412f)

## Features
- Generate a PDF version of the _The Swift Programming Language_ book, perfect for offline browsing or printing.
- Choose from one of two [rendering modes](https://github.com/ekassos/swift-book-pdf/wiki/Customization-Options#rendering-modes--):
   - Digital mode with hyperlinks for cross-references between chapters and external links.
   - Print mode with page numbers accompanying cross-references between chapters and full URLs shown in footnotes for external links.
- Both versions follow the DocC rendering style used in [docs.swift.org](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/), including code highlighting.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Git
- LuaTeX. If you don't have an existing LaTeX installation, see [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/), [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org).
- Fonts for typesetting. Learn [which fonts are required to typeset the TSPL book](https://github.com/ekassos/swift-book-pdf/wiki/Fonts).

## Installation
### Latest PyPI stable release
```
pip install swift-book-pdf
```

## Usage
### Basic usage
Call `swift_book_pdf` without any arguments to save the resulting PDF as `swift_book.pdf` in the current directory. The package defaults to the digital [rendering mode](https://github.com/ekassos/swift-book-pdf/wiki/Customization-Options#rendering-modes--) in Letter [paper size](https://github.com/ekassos/swift-book-pdf/wiki/Customization-Options#paper-sizes--).
```
$ swift_book_pdf

[INFO]: Downloading TSPL files...
[INFO]: Creating PDF in digital (light) mode...
[INFO]: PDF saved to ./swift-book.pdf
```

When invoked, `swift_book_pdf` will:
1. Clone the `swift-book` [repository](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-book)
2. Convert all Markdown source files into a single LaTeX document
3. Render the LaTeX document into the final PDF document

> [!NOTE]
> swift_book_pdf will create a temporary directory to store the swift-book repository, LaTeX file and intermediate files produced during typesetting. This temporary directory is removed after the PDF is generated.

### Customization
swift-book-pdf offers a range of options to customize your rendering of _The Swift Programming Language_ book. Learn how to [make the TSPL book your own](https://github.com/ekassos/swift-book-pdf/wiki/Customization-Options).
