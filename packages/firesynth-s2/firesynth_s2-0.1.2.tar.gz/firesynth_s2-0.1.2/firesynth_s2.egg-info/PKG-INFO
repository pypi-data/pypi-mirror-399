# FireSynth-S2

**FireSynth-S2** is a physically-informed **synthetic Sentinel-2 wildfire-risk spectral dataset generator** designed for research and machine-learning applications.
It produces realistic **Sentinel-2 band reflectance values** together with **vegetation & burn indices** under both **fire** and **non-fire** scenarios — enabling reproducible wildfire risk modeling without requiring raw satellite downloads.

---

## 🌍 Motivation

Obtaining labeled wildfire training data from satellite imagery is:

* ⚠ time-consuming
* ⚠ storage-heavy
* ⚠ often incomplete
* ⚠ difficult to balance (fire vs non-fire)

FireSynth-S2 solves this by generating **statistically realistic, label-balanced synthetic samples** that reflect published spectral wildfire behavior — ideal for:

✔ model prototyping
✔ academic experiments
✔ teaching
✔ dataset augmentation

---

## 🚀 Features

* Sentinel-2-like spectral bands:

  * `B02_blue`
  * `B03_green`
  * `B04_red`
  * `B08_nir`
  * `B11_swir1`
  * `B12_swir2`
* Derived indices:

  * `NDVI`
  * `NDWI`
  * `NBR`
* Binary wildfire label (`1 = fire`, `0 = non-fire`)
* California-tuned priors (expandable)
* Deterministic & reproducible generation
* Export to Pandas DataFrame
* Lightweight (no remote downloads)

## 📦 Installation

### TestPyPI (current release)

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple firesynth-s2
```

---

## 🧠 Quick Start

```python
from firesynth import FireSynthS2

gen = FireSynthS2(region="California")

df = gen.generate(10000)

print(df.head())
```

Example output:

| B04_red | B08_nir | NDVI |
| ------: | ------: | ---: |
|    0.12 |    0.55 | 0.64 |
|    0.18 |    0.72 | 0.60 |
|    0.30 |    0.40 | 0.14 |

---

## 🔬 Scientific Basis

FireSynth-S2 reflects documented wildfire-driven spectral behavior:

| Condition               | NIR (B08) | SWIR (B11/B12)     | NDVI    | NBR      |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| **Healthy vegetation**  | High      | Low                | High    | High     |
| **Stressed vegetation** | Medium    | Rising             | Falling | Falling  |
| **Active / burned**     | Decreased | Strongly increased | Low     | Very low |

Values are sampled from distributions calibrated to:

* vegetation physiology
* soil reflectance
* moisture loss
* combustion impacts
