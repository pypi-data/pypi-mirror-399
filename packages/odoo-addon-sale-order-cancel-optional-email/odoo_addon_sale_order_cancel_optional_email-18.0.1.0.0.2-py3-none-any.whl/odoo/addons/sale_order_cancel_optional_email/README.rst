This module changes the default behavior when cancelling a confirmed
sales order.

In standard Odoo, when you click "Cancel" on a confirmed sales order, a
wizard opens proposing to send an email notification to the customer.
This can lead to accidental emails being sent to customers.

With this module installed:

- The **Cancel** button directly cancels the order without showing any
  wizard
- A new **Send Email and Cancel** button is added (secondary style) that
  opens the wizard when you explicitly want to notify the customer about
  the cancellation
- The wizard only shows the "Send and cancel" and "Discard" buttons (the
  redundant "Cancel" button is removed from the wizard)
