    "title": "Rotational Packet Protocol (RPP): A Semantic Addressing Architecture for Consent-Aware Memory Systems",
    "description": "RPP defines a 28-bit semantic addressing system where addresses encode meaning (what kind of data, how accessible, where to route) rather than just memory locations. The resolver returns simple decisions: allow, deny, or route. This specification includes the address format, resolver architecture, and reference implementations in Python, Haskell, and Clash (FPGA).",
