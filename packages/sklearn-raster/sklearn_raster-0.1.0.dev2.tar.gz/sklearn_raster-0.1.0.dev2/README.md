[![Build status](https://github.com/lemma-osu/sklearn-raster/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lemma-osu/sklearn-raster/actions/workflows/ci.yaml) [![Documentation status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/sklearn-raster/badge/?version=latest)](https://sklearn-raster.readthedocs.io/)

> ⚠️ **WARNING: sklearn-raster is in active development!** ⚠️

[`sklearn-raster`](https://github.com/lemma-osu/sklearn-raster) extends [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and other compatible estimators to work directly with raster data. This allows you to train models with tabular data and predict raster outputs directly while preserving metadata like spatial references, band names, and NoData masks.

## Features

- ⚡ Parallelized functions + larger-than-memory data using [Dask](https://www.dask.org/)
- 🌐 Automatic handling of spatial references, band names, and masks
- 🔢 Support for n-dimensional feature arrays, e.g. time series rasters

## Quick-Start

1. Install optional dependencies for loading data and plotting results:

    ```bash
    pip install "sklearn-raster[tutorials]"
    ```

1. Wrap a `scikit-learn` estimator with a [`FeatureArrayEstimator`](https://sklearn-raster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/feature_array_estimator) to enable raster-based predictions:

    ```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    from sklearn_raster import FeatureArrayEstimator

    est = FeatureArrayEstimator(RandomForestRegressor())
    ```

1. Load a [custom dataset](https://sklearn-raster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/datasets/swo_ecoplot) of features and targets and fit the wrapped estimator:

    ```python
    from sklearn_raster.datasets import load_swo_ecoplot

    X_image, X, y = load_swo_ecoplot(as_dataset=True)
    est.fit(X, y)
    ```

1. Generate predictions from a `numpy` or `xarray` raster with predictors as bands:

    ```python
    pred = est.predict(X_image)
    pred["PSME_COV"].plot()
    ```
