Then, for every mainteance request of this equipment, *Picking List*
button allows us to make consumptions, that will be picking documents
with their own sequence:

By default, the origin location for this operations will be the stock
location for the default warehouse, and destination a new *Consumptions*
location, that will not compute for stock inventory, like e.g. partner
locations:

From both request and equipment forms these stock operations and
*Product Moves* are available.

Return operations are also enabled, and will be linked to the request
and equipment as well:
