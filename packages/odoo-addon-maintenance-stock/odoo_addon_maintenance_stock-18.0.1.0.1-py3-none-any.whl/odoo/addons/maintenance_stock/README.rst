Usage
=====

Once installed, first you should enable consumptions for a certain
equipment and filling a default warehouse for the picking operations:

|image1|

Then, for every mainteance request of this equipment, *Picking List*
button allows us to make consumptions, that will be picking documents
with their own sequence:

|image3|

By default, the origin location for this operations will be the stock
location for the default warehouse, and destination a new *Consumptions*
location, that will not compute for stock inventory, like e.g. partner
locations:

|image4|

From both request and equipment forms these stock operations and
*Product Moves* are available.

Return operations are also enabled, and will be linked to the request
and equipment as well:

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Product standard list. Enable defining product standard lists (at
  least, product and quantity per line), and link them with equipments.
  Then, every maintenance request could select one of them and
  automatically fill the product and quantity list.
