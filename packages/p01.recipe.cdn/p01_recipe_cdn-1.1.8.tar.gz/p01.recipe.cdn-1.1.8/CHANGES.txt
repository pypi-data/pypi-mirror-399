1.1.8 (2025-12-29)
------------------

- Fixed lpjsmin dependency: addMinifyLibrary now also adds jsmin when
  lpjsmin is specified, since lpjsmin requires jsmin to function.


1.1.7 (2025-12-29)
------------------

- fix python 2/3 tests, Improved Jinja2, glue and MarkupSafe egg setup for testing


1.1.6 (2025-12-29)
------------------

- Python 2/3 compatibility: Fixed all print statements in minify.py, 
  extract.py, deploy.py to use print() function

- Python 2/3 compatibility: Fixed cStringIO import to use io.BytesIO

- Python 2/3 compatibility: Fixed ConfigParser import in sprites.py

- Python 2/3 compatibility: Fixed subprocess output decoding in cmder.py
  (bytes to str for Python 3)

- Python 2/3 compatibility: Fixed JSON file reading in extract.py and
  minify.py to use proper encoding (json.loads(bytes) fails in Python 3)

- Python 2/3 compatibility: Updated all file operations to use
  context managers (with statement) and explicit UTF-8 encoding

- Refactored sprites.py to use external glue package from PyPI instead of
  bundled copy. The bundled glue.py can now be removed.

- Added extras_require 'sprites' for glue and Pillow dependencies.
  Use p01.recipe.cdn[sprites] to install sprite generation support.

- Simplified GlueRecipe to use p01.recipe.cdn[sprites] instead of
  manual PIL/Pillow handling.

- Added Python version classifiers to setup.py


1.1.5 (2025-08-15)
------------------

- bugfix; typo and more PIL version cleanup


1.1.4 (2025-08-15)
------------------

- bugfix; fix broken sprites processing, Skip PIL.VERSION access which is gone.


1.1.3 (2025-07-18)

- make code python 3 compatible


1.1.2 (2015-09-11)
------------------

- bugfix: fix broken i18n cdn resource path extraction


1.1.1 (2015-09-03)
------------------

- feature: use better error message if a zrt-resource include fails because
  of a missing resource (adapter) lookup.


1.1.0 (2015-06-30)
------------------

- feature: check version before write the verisons and zrt-replace directives
  the the related files. This prevents that the less compiler get invoked for
  nothing because fo the modified zrt-replace.less file.

- bugfix: fix i18n resource extraction


1.0.0 (2015-06-29)
------------------

- feature: support pkg, file include in header option. This allows us to
  include files with generated zrt-replace arguments. One usecase for this new
  option is the new cdn extraction concept which is able to version each
  resource file based on subversion version or the related package version.
  This new concept generates a file including all the related zrt-replace.less
  rules.

- feature: switch to json config file based minify script processing. This
  allows us to use larger headers and source files and isn't limited by
  cmd line length.

- feature: added option for extract each resource with it's own version based
  on subversion version. See p01.cdn version 1.0.0 for support cdn resources.

- feature: generate zrt-replace.less for extracted resources including all
  the related zrt-replace rules. This file can get included as header option
  in the p01.recipe.cdn:minify recipe


0.5.7 (2015-03-17)
------------------

- bugfix: support missing parser instance. The parser was missing for show an
  error message, e.g. missing directory path


0.5.6 (2014-06-10)
------------------

- extract: print the current layer


0.5.5 (2014-05-08)
------------------

- bugfix: The skip option didn't work. Now you can define optional files by
  it's filename and the minify script will only include this skipped files
  and not minify the file source.

- bugfix: The libs option didn't work. Now you can define different minify
  libraries for each file.


0.5.4 (2013-11-13)
------------------

- Output the resource parameters when extract fails


0.5.3 (2013-03-27)
------------------

- bugfix: use an empty list as default skip option and not None


0.5.2 (2013-03-19)
------------------

- feature: support skip option in extract recipe. This allows to define a list
  of filenames thcih get not extracted to the output. This allows to skip the
  source files from get deployed to the cdn output folder.

- feature: support slimit mangle, mangle_toplevel and cssmin wrap options. You
  can use them as slimit_mangle, slimit_mangle_toplevel and cssmin_wrap in your
  buildout.


0.5.1 (2013-01-28)
------------------

- improve error handling, show traceback from executed method
