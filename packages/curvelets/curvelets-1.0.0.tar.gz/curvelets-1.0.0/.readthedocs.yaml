# Version Management:
# - The version is dynamically generated by hatch-vcs from git tags during pip install
# - When building from an exact tag (e.g., v0.1.0b2), the version is clean: "0.1.0b2"
# - When building from a commit after a tag, dev metadata is added: "0.1.0b2.dev1+..."
# - For stable documentation, configure Read the Docs web UI to build from release tags
# - The "stable" version should point to the latest release tag (e.g., v0.1.0b2)
# - The "latest" version should point to the main branch (default)
