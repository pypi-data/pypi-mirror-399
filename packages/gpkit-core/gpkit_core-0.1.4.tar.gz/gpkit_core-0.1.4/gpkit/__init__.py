GPkit is now installed with solver(s) {settings['installed_solvers']}
To incorporate new solvers at a later date, run `gpkit.build()`.

If you encounter any bugs or issues using GPkit, please open a new issue at
https://github.com/beautifulmachines/gpkit-core/issues/new.

Finally, we hope you find our documentation (https://gpkit.readthedocs.io/) and
engineering-design models (https://github.com/beautifulmachines/gpkit-models/)
useful for your own applications.

Enjoy!
