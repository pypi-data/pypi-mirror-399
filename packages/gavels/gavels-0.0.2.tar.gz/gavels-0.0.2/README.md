# gavels

**gavels** is an upcoming Python SDK for calling an asynchronous judgment API.

The API will allow users to submit a request for judgment and retrieve the result
later using an async workflow.

⚠️ This package is currently a **placeholder**, published to reserve the name
on PyPI. The full SDK will be released in a future version.

Planned features:
- Async judgment submission
- Polling and await helpers
- Simple sync wrapper for non-developers
