# 🐍 Nexus Gateway Python SDK

The official Python client for **Nexus Gateway** – The High-Performance AI Semantic Caching Layer.

This library provides a simple interface to interact with the Nexus Gateway API, enabling semantic caching, multi-model routing, and automated cost optimization for LLM applications.

## Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install nexus-gateway

```

(Note: For local development, you can run pip install . in the root directory)

# Quick Start
code
Python
from nexus_gateway import NexusClient

# 1. Initialize the Client
client = NexusClient(api_key="nk-your-key-here")

# 2. Chat with AI (Defaults to GPT-3.5)
response = client.chat("Explain quantum computing in one sentence.")

print(response)
# Output: "Quantum computing uses qubits to perform calculations..."

# Switching Models (The Universal Router)
```
Nexus Gateway supports multiple AI providers. You can switch models instantly without changing your code structure.

Use Claude 3:
code
Python

response = client.chat(
    message="Write a poem about rust.", 
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229"
)
Use GPT-4:
code
Python
response = client.chat(
    message="Complex math problem...", 
    model="gpt-4"
)

```
