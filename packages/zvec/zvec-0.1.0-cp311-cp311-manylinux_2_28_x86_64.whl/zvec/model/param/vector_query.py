@dataclass(frozen=True)
class VectorQuery:
    """Represents a vector search query for a specific field in a collection.

    A `VectorQuery` can be constructed using either a document ID (to look up
    its vector) or an explicit vector. It may optionally include index-specific
    query parameters to control search behavior (e.g., `ef` for HNSW, `nprobe` for IVF).

    Exactly one of `id` or `vector` should be provided. If both are given,
    behavior is implementation-defined (typically `id` takes precedence).

    Attributes:
        field_name (str): Name of the vector field to query.
        id (Optional[str], optional): Document ID to fetch vector from. Default is None.
        vector (VectorType, optional): Explicit query vector. Default is None.
        param (Optional[Union[HnswQueryParam, IVFQueryParam]], optional):
            Index-specific query parameters. Default is None.

    Examples:
        >>> import zvec
        >>> # Query by ID
        >>> q1 = zvec.VectorQuery(field_name="embedding", id="doc123")
        >>> # Query by vector
        >>> q2 = zvec.VectorQuery(
        ...     field_name="embedding",
        ...     vector=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
        ...     param=HnswQueryParam(ef=300)
        ... )
