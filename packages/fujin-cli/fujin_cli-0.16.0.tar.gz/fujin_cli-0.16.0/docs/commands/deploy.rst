Overview
--------

This is the core deployment command. It builds your application locally, bundles all necessary files, uploads them to the server, and installs/configures everything.

Use ``fujin deploy`` for:

- Deploying code changes
- Updating configuration
- Updating environment variables
- Refreshing systemd units or Caddy configuration

How it works
------------

Here's a high-level overview of what happens when you run the ``deploy`` command:

1. **Resolve secrets**: If you have defined a ``secrets`` configuration, it will be used to retrieve pull the ``secrets`` defined in your ``envfile``.

2. **Build the Application**: Your application is built using the ``build_command`` specified in your configuration.

3. **Bundle Artifacts**: All deployment assets are staged locally into a single tarball (``deploy.tar.gz``). The bundle contains your dist file, optional ``requirements.txt``, the rendered ``.env``, generated systemd unit files, the Caddyfile (when enabled), and install/uninstall scripts. A checksum is calculated for integrity verification.

4. **Upload Once**: The bundle is uploaded to the host under ``{app_dir}/.versions/`` and its checksum is verified remotely. Retries are offered on mismatch.

5. **Install from Bundle**: The bundle is extracted on the host and ``install.sh`` installs the project: Python mode creates/uses the virtualenv and installs dependencies; binary mode copies the binary into place. If configured, ``release_command`` runs after installation.

6. **Configure and Start Services**: Generated ``systemd`` unit files are installed (stale ones are cleaned up), services are enabled and restarted, and the Caddy configuration is applied/reloaded when enabled.  

7. **Prune Old Bundles**: Old bundles are removed from ``.versions`` according to ``versions_to_keep``.

8. **Completion**: A success message is displayed, and the URL to access the deployed project is provided.

Below is an example of the layout and structure of a deployed application:

    .. tab-item:: python package

        .. code-block:: shell
