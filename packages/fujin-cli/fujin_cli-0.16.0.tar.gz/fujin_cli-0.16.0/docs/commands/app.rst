Overview
--------

Use ``fujin app`` to control your application's systemd services:

- Start, stop, and restart services
- View real-time logs
- Inspect service status
- Access systemd unit configurations
- View deployment history

The app command works with process names defined in your ``fujin.toml`` and intelligently handles related units (sockets, timers).

Usage Examples
--------------

Given the following configuration in ``fujin.toml``:

.. code-block:: toml

    [processes.web]
    command = "uvicorn app:app"
    socket = true

    [processes.worker]
    command = "celery -A app worker"
    timer = { on_calendar = "*:00" }  # Run hourly

You can interact with services in various ways:

**Manage all services**

.. code-block:: bash

    # Start/Stop/Restart all services (web, worker, socket, timer)
    fujin app start
    fujin app stop
    fujin app restart

**Manage specific process groups**

When targeting a process by name, it includes related units (sockets, timers).

.. code-block:: bash

    # Starts web.service AND web.socket
    fujin app start web

    # Logs for worker.service AND worker.timer
    fujin app logs worker

**Manage specific systemd units**

You can be specific by appending the unit type.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Only restart the service, not the socket
    fujin app restart web.service

    # Only show logs for the timer
    fujin app logs worker.timer

    # Only stop the socket
    fujin app stop web.socket

Logs Command
------------

The ``logs`` command is one of the most frequently used app subcommands. It provides various options for viewing application logs.

**Basic usage**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Show logs for all services
   fujin app logs

   # Show logs for specific process
   fujin app logs web

   # Show logs for specific unit
   fujin app logs web.service

**Follow logs in real-time**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Follow logs (like tail -f)
   fujin app logs -f

   # Follow logs for specific process
   fujin app logs -f web

**Control log output**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Show last 100 lines (default: 50)
   fujin app logs -n 100

   # Show last 200 lines and follow
   fujin app logs -n 200 -f

   # Show all available logs
   fujin app logs -n 0

**Logs for specific timeframes**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Logs since last hour
   fujin app logs --since "1 hour ago"

   # Logs since specific time
   fujin app logs --since "2024-12-28 14:30:00"

   # Logs from the last day
   fujin app logs --since yesterday

**Log filtering and inspection**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Show only errors (pipe through grep)
   fujin app logs | grep ERROR

   # Follow logs and filter for specific pattern
   fujin app logs -f web | grep "Request processed"

Info Command
------------

Display application information and process status overview.

.. code-block:: bash

   fujin app info

The info command displays:

- Application name and directory
- Local version (from your project)
- Remote version (currently deployed)
- Available rollback targets
- Python version (for python-package mode)
- Running URL (if webserver enabled)
- Status table showing all processes (active/inactive/failed)

Start, Stop, Restart Commands
------------------------------

**Start services**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Start all services
   fujin app start

   # Start specific process (includes socket/timer)
   fujin app start web

   # Start only the service unit
   fujin app start web.service

**Stop services**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Stop all services
   fujin app stop

   # Stop specific process
   fujin app stop worker

   # Stop only the timer
   fujin app stop worker.timer

**Restart services**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Restart all services (useful after config changes)
   fujin app restart

   # Restart specific process
   fujin app restart web

   # Restart to reload environment variables
   fujin app restart

Shell Command
-------------

Open an interactive shell on the server in your app's directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Open bash shell in app directory
   fujin app shell

This is useful for:

- Inspecting deployed files
- Running one-off commands
- Debugging deployment issues
- Checking file permissions

Cat Command
-----------

Display systemd unit file contents for your services.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Show unit file for web service
   fujin app cat web

   # Show unit file for specific unit type
   fujin app cat web.service

   # Show all units
   fujin app cat units

   # Show Caddy configuration
   fujin app cat caddy


Common Workflows
----------------

**After deployment, check everything is running**

.. code-block:: bash

   fujin app info
   fujin app logs -n 20

**Debug a failing service**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Check status
   fujin app info web

   # View recent logs
   fujin app logs web -n 100

   # Follow logs while restarting
   fujin app restart web

**Monitor production application**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Follow all logs
   fujin app logs -f

   # Follow only web service logs
   fujin app logs -f web

**After changing environment variables**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Restart to pick up new .env
   fujin app restart

   # Verify the change took effect
   fujin app logs -n 10

**Investigate high memory usage**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Check current status
   fujin app info

   # View logs for memory-related messages
   fujin app logs | grep -i "memory\|oom"

   # Access shell to investigate further
   fujin app shell
