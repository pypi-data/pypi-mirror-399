mcp_servers:
  spec_inspector:
    short: "Query spec status, guardrail coverage, and task progress"
    description: |
      Provides real-time access to specification data without reading files.
      Capabilities: list specs, check guardrail coverage, get task progress,
      validate answerpacks, lint specs.
    default: true
    why_matters: "Saves ~96% tokens compared to reading spec files directly"

  coverage_reporter:
    short: "Test coverage metrics by service and guardrail"
    description: |
      Provides test coverage data without parsing coverage reports.
      Capabilities: overall coverage, per-service breakdown, coverage by guardrail,

    default: true
    why_matters: "Enables AI to check coverage before marking tasks complete"

  db_inspector:
    short: "PostgreSQL schema, RLS policies, and index inspection"
    description: |

      Security (RLS) policies, and indexes without parsing files.
      This is a template server that should be copied and customized for your project.
    default: false
    why_matters: "Saves token usage for schema-heavy inspections and ensures RLS policy correctness"

# Technical terms glossary for non-technical users
glossary:
  RLS:
    full_name: "Row-Level Security"
    short: "Database-enforced access control for multi-tenant data isolation"
    description: |
      A database feature that automatically filters query results based on
      the current user's permissions. Instead of adding WHERE tenant_id = X
      to every query, RLS policies enforce this at the database level.
    example: |
      In PostgreSQL:
      CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON orders
        USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id'));
    why_matters: |
      Prevents data leaks even if application code forgets to filter.
      Critical for multi-tenant apps where one customer shouldn't see another's data.

  PHI:
    full_name: "Protected Health Information"
    short: "Any health data that can identify a patient"
    description: |
      Any health information that can identify a patient, including names,
      dates, diagnoses, treatments, and 16 other identifiers defined by HIPAA.
    example: |
      PHI includes: patient name, DOB, medical record number, diagnosis codes,
      prescription history, appointment dates.
      NOT PHI: Aggregate statistics like "50% of patients have diabetes"
    why_matters: |
      HIPAA requires specific protections for PHI. Improper handling can
      result in fines up to $1.5 million per violation category per year.

  HIPAA:
    full_name: "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act"
    short: "US federal law protecting patient health information"
    description: |
      US federal law that sets standards for protecting sensitive patient
      health information. Applies to healthcare providers, health plans,
      and their business associates.
    requirements: |
      - Administrative safeguards (policies, training)
      - Physical safeguards (facility access)
      - Technical safeguards (encryption, access control, audit logs)
    why_matters: |
      Legal requirement for US healthcare applications. Non-compliance can
      result in civil and criminal penalties.

  OWASP:
    full_name: "Open Web Application Security Project"
    short: "Industry standard for web application security"
    description: |
      A nonprofit foundation that produces security guidelines, including
      the famous OWASP Top 10 list of most critical web application security risks.
    top_10: |
      1. Injection (SQL, command)
      2. Broken Authentication
      3. Sensitive Data Exposure
      4. XML External Entities (XXE)
      5. Broken Access Control
      6. Security Misconfiguration
      7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
      8. Insecure Deserialization
      9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
      10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
    why_matters: "Following OWASP guidelines prevents the most common security vulnerabilities"

  idempotency:
    full_name: "Idempotency"
    short: "Operations that produce same result when repeated"
    description: |
      An operation is idempotent if performing it multiple times has the same
      effect as performing it once. Critical for handling retries safely.
    example: |
      Idempotent: GET /user/123 - returns same user each time
      Idempotent: PUT /user/123 {name: "John"} - sets name to John each time
      NOT idempotent: POST /orders - creates new order each time

      To make POST idempotent, use idempotency keys:
      POST /orders with header X-Idempotency-Key: abc123
    why_matters: |
      Network failures cause retries. Without idempotency, retries can cause
      duplicate charges, duplicate orders, or data corruption.

  double_entry:
    full_name: "Double-Entry Bookkeeping"
    short: "Accounting method where every transaction affects two accounts"
    description: |
      An accounting system where every transaction is recorded in at least
      two accounts: a debit in one and a credit in another. The sum of all
      debits must equal the sum of all credits.
    example: |
      Customer pays $100 for service:
      - Debit: Cash account +$100
      - Credit: Revenue account +$100

      Internal transfer of $50:
      - Debit: Destination account +$50
      - Credit: Source account -$50
    why_matters: |
      Automatically catches errors - if debits don't equal credits, something
      is wrong. Required for financial audits and regulatory compliance.
