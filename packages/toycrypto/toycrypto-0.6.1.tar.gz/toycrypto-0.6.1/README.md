----

This is a collection of utilities that can be used for illustrating or
exploring some cryptographic concepts.
Although it includes implementations of some cryptographic algorithms,
these are **not secure** implementations.

See the [documentation] for use (or not) and [reasons why this exists](https://jpgoldberg.github.io/toy-crypto-math/why/).

Note that if you need to do cryptography in Python,
I recommend [pyca](https://cryptography.io/) or [PyNaCl](https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
If you want tools to explore the algebraic and number theoretic constructs used in cryptography,
look at [SageMath](https://doc.sagemath.org/) or [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html).
