## Unreleased

## 0.6.1 2025-12-30

### Improved

- `birthday.quantile` and `utils.find_zero` are more accurate.
- `birthday` document examples improved.
- Various documentation improvements.
- Slightly more consistent coding style.

## 0.6.0 2025-12-28

Important highlights. This release

- deprecating utilities that duplicate what is available in the Python standard library,
- renames `birthday.Q` to `birthday.quantile` (old names deprecated)
- renames `birthday.P` to `birthday.probability` (old names deprecated)
- renames some attributes (deprecating the old names),
- fixes a major bug in `birthday.quantile`,
- includes a number of changes to building, testing, code tidying that are not visible to users but may be relevant to those working with the source.

### Fixed

- `birthday.quantile` is now usable for large n, small p. (Tests had not been running before)
- Many documentation typos

### Deprecations

- `nt.lcm`, `nt.gcd`, `nt.isqrt` are all deprecated. Use the corresponding functions from the standard `math` library instead.
- `birthday.Q` and `birthday.P` are renamed `birthday.quantile` and `birthday.probability` (old names deprecated)
- `vigenere.Alphabet.abc2idx` is renamed ``vigenere.Alphabet.inverse_map` (old name depreciated).

### Added

- `utils.FrozenBidict`
- `utils.find_zero`
- `birthday.quantile` (renaming of now deprecated `birthday.Q`)
- `birthday.probability` (renaming of now deprecated `birthday.P`)

- RSA OAEP docs

## 0.4.1 2025-06-19

### Fixed

- Fixes incomprehensible type error that popped up with Python 3.13.5.

- Documentation now builds correctly in CI (instead of merely on my machine).

### Changed

- Minor documentation fixes
- `*requirements.txt` files are on the way out. Dependencies are exclusively managed in `pyproject.toml`.

### Internal

- GitHub Actions now use `uv`

## 0.4.0 2025-06-16

### Changed

- Some utilities have been moved from the `types` and `utils` modules to the new `bit_utils` module.
- The interface to the various Sieve classes has changed. It is more stable now.
- The sieve class previously known as `sieve.Sieve` is now called `sieve.BaSieve`
- There is a `sieve.Sieve` class which is an alias for one of the other sieve classes.
- Substantial optimizations in some of the sieve classes.
- [`sieve` module documentation](https://jpgoldberg.github.io/toy-crypto-math/sieve.html) includes some comparative speed charts.
- Installation instructions from git are now correct (thank you [domdfcoding](https://github.com/domdfcoding) for [this sphinx-toolbox feature](https://github.com/sphinx-toolbox/sphinx-toolbox/pull/185).

### Added

- `bit_utils` module. Note that some of its members have been from the `types` and `utils` modules to this.
- Various scripts used for benchmarking some Sieve methods.

### Internal

- Dependency management has largely moved to `uv`.

## 0.3.0 2025-04-25

### Added

- rsa encrypt and decrypt better handle int-like parameters.
- Installation option `c-deps` to include dependencies that are not pure Python.
  The `bitarray` dependency will not be installed without this.
- Indistinguishability games each have a constant boolean `TRACK_CHALLENGE_CTEXTS`.
- A pure python Sieve of Eratosthenes using sets
- A pure python Sieve of Eratosthenes using ints
- A Protocol for all of the sieve classes
- `rand.choices()` behaves like [random.choices()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices), except that it uses the random number generator from the standard library `secrets` module.

### Changed

- `sieve` is no longer in the `nt` module, but it is in the new `sieve` module.
- `bitarray` package is optional. At the moment, `nt.Sieve` will raise `NotImplementedError` if bitarray is not available.
- Attempt to improve `sec_games` documentation. At least to make the transition tables more legible.
- Improved `birthday` module documentation.
- Improved Sieve testing

## 0.2.2 2025-01-15

### Fixed

- CCA2 game no longer rejects decryption of ctexts that were created in previous rounds

### Changed

- `sec_games.<game>.T_TABLE` has had a type change, with use of enumerations.
  
### Added

- State diagrams for sec_games documentation.

- Enums for states and transitions for `sec_games`.
  
  Yes, they are ugly, and Graphviz makes it hard to place edge labels well,
  but I worked on this, so you have to see them.

- Expanded (perhaps excessively) sec_games documentation.

## 0.2.1 2025-01-13

### Fixed

- PyPi package metadata should now be correct.

### Added

- IND-CCA games are now available.

- Exposed challenger state transition tables for IND-{EAV,CPA} games in `T_TABLE` for each class.

## 0.2.0 2025-01-02

### Changed

- Minimum Python version is now 3.12
  
  This was needed for type aliases with type parameters.

### Added

- `IndCpa` is back (and distinct from `IndEav`)

## 0.1.7 2025-01-01

### Changed

- `IndCpa` is now correctly called `IndEav`

## 0.1.6 2024-12-31

### Added

- `sec_games` module with symmetric IND-CPA game

### Changed

- birthday.Q uses simple approximation when p > MAX_BIRTHDAY_Q instead of raising exception

### Improved

- Improved test coverage for birthday module
- Documentation improvements

## 0.1.5 2024-11-30

### Changed

- `vigenere` now only works with `str`. If you want to do things with `bytes`, use `utils.xor`.

- Vigenère encryption and decryption no longer advance the key when passing through input that is not in the alphabet.
  
### Fixed

- Vigenère behavior on input not in alphabet is less incoherent than before, though perhaps it should be considered undefined.

- Sprinkled more `py.typed` files around so this really should get marked at typed now.

### Added

- `utils.hamming_distance()` is now a thing.
- `vigenere.probable_keysize()` is also now a thing.
- `utils.xor()` can take an Iterator[int] has a message, so the entire message does not need to be stored
- The `utils.Xor` class creates an Iterator of xoring a message and a pad.
  
### Improved

- `birthday` module now has a [documentation page](https://jpgoldberg.github.io/toy-crypto-math/birthday.html).
- `types` module now has a [documentation page](https://jpgoldberg.github.io/toy-crypto-math/types.html).

## 0.1.4 2024-11-06

### Changed

- keyword argument name `b` changed to "`base`" in `utils.digit_count`.

### Added

- Text encoder for the R129 challenge is exposed in `utils`.
  
  Previously this had just lived only in test routines.

### Fixed

- `utils.digit_count` Fixed bug that could yield incorrect results in close cases.
  
### Improved

- `rand` module now has a [documentation page](https://jpgoldberg.github.io/toy-crypto-math/rand.html).
- Improved error messages for some Type and Value Errors.
- Made it harder to accidentally mutate things in the `ec` class that shouldn't be mutated.
- Improved documentation and test coverage for `utils` and `ec`.
- Improved documentation for the `rsa` module.
- Minor improvements to other documentation and docstrings

## 0.1.3 2024-10-17

### Added

- `py.typed` file. (This is the reason for the version bump.)

### Improved

- `ec` classes use `@property` instead of exposing some attributes directly.
- `ec` module now has a [documentation page]( https://jpgoldberg.github.io/toy-crypto-math/ec.html).
- This changelog is now in the proper location.
- This changelog is better formatted.

## 0.1.2 2024-10-15

### Added

- _Partial_ [documentation][docs].

### Improved

- Testing covers all supported Python versions (3.11, 3.12, 3.13)

## 0.1.1 2024-10-11

### Removed

- `redundent.prod()`. It was annoying type checkers and is, after all, redundant.

### Added

- `utils.xor()` function for xor-ing bytes with a pad.
- Explicit support for Python 3.13
- Github Actions for linting and testing

### Improved

- Conforms to some stronger lint checks
- Spelling in some code comments

## 0.1.0 - 2024-10-10

### Added

- First public release
