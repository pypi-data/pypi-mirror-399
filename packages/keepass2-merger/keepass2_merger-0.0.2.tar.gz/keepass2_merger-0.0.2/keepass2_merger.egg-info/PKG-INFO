A python package to interactively merge two KeePass2 databases.

## Installation

You can install keepass2-merger via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/keepass2-merger/):
```bash
pip install keepass2-merger
```

## Usage

Merge two KeePass databases interactively:

```bash
keepass2-merger /path/to/db1.kdbx /path/to/db2.kdbx /path/to/output.kdbx
```

You will be prompted for both database passwords (securely via `getpass`) and then shown each change
needed to merge new or updated groups/entries from the second file into the first. A full-screen curses
UI is used to avoid leaving scrollback residue; press the on-screen keys to apply or skip each change.
No deletions are performed; the tool recommends newer versions when conflicts arise. The recycle bin is
ignored. Use `--no-curses` to fall back to a plain prompt UI.
