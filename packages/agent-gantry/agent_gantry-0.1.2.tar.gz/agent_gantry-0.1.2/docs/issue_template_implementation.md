# Issue Template Implementation Summary

This document maps the strategic expansion areas from the problem statement to the implemented GitHub issue templates.

## Problem Statement → Template Mapping

### 1. Advanced Routing & Orchestration
**Problem Statement Areas:**
- Hierarchical / Domain Routing (Router of Routers pattern)
- Tool Chaining / Pipelines (Atomic Workflows)
- Parameter-Aware Routing (Contextual Feasibility)

**Template:** `01-advanced-routing-orchestration.md`
- ✅ Covers all three sub-areas with checkboxes
- ✅ Explains current "flat" semantic retrieval limitation
- ✅ Provides examples for each approach
- ✅ Includes context about scaling from 100 to 10,000 tools

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `routing`, `orchestration`

### 2. Enterprise Security & Governance
**Problem Statement Areas:**
- Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Protocol for sensitive tools
- PII Redaction / Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Rate Limiting & Quotas (per-tool or per-user)

**Template:** `02-enterprise-security-governance.md`
- ✅ Covers all three compliance features
- ✅ Includes compliance standards checklist (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.)
- ✅ Explains current zero-trust capabilities
- ✅ Provides security model and risk mitigation sections

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `security`, `governance`, `compliance`

### 3. Frictionless Onboarding (Importers)
**Problem Statement Areas:**
- OpenAPI / Swagger Ingestion (one-line import from REST APIs)
- Database Introspection (auto-generate CRUD tools from schema)
- Other integration sources

**Template:** `03-frictionless-onboarding.md`
- ✅ Covers OpenAPI/Swagger ingestion with example
- ✅ Covers database introspection with example
- ✅ Includes schema mapping section
- ✅ Lists additional integration ideas (GraphQL, gRPC, cloud providers)
- ✅ Addresses authentication and configuration concerns

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `importer`, `dx`, `onboarding`

### 4. Developer Experience (DX) & UI
**Problem Statement Areas:**
- Gantry Dashboard (Web UI with visualization, monitoring, testing)
- Simulation & Replay (snapshot testing for agents)
- Debugging and development tools

**Template:** `04-developer-experience-ui.md`
- ✅ Comprehensive dashboard feature list (vector space viz, circuit breaker monitoring, etc.)
- ✅ Simulation & replay for regression testing
- ✅ Visualization tools section
- ✅ Debugging tools section
- ✅ UI/UX considerations and tech stack preferences

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `dx`, `ui`, `tooling`

### 5. Smart Learning
**Problem Statement Areas:**
- Feedback Loop (RLHF for Tools)
- Learning from tool selection failures
- Adaptive embeddings and routing

**Template:** `05-smart-learning.md`
- ✅ Comprehensive RLHF implementation example with code
- ✅ Adaptive embeddings section
- ✅ Tool performance learning
- ✅ User preference learning
- ✅ Feedback collection strategy and privacy considerations
- ✅ Evaluation metrics section

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `learning`, `rlhf`, `adaptive`

### 6. State Management
**Problem Statement Areas:**
- Session Memory (context store for stateful tools)
- Cross-tool state sharing
- Avoiding external DB requirements for simple state

**Template:** `06-state-management.md`
- ✅ Detailed session memory implementation examples
- ✅ Three different API design options (context parameter, session object, decorator)
- ✅ State scoping (session, user, global, tool-scoped)
- ✅ Persistence strategy options (in-memory, Redis, DB, file-based)
- ✅ Thread safety and TTL considerations
- ✅ Comprehensive use cases (multi-step workflows, file operations, caching, etc.)

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `state`, `memory`, `session`

## Additional Templates

### Bug Report (`bug_report.md`)
Standard bug report template with:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (version, Python version, OS, dependencies)
- Code examples and error messages

**Labels:** `bug`

---

### General Feature Request (`general_feature_request.md`)
Catch-all template for features not covered by strategic templates:
- Feature description and motivation
- Proposed solution
- Alternatives considered
- Use cases and benefits
- Links to strategic templates for appropriate features

**Labels:** `enhancement`

---

## Configuration

### `config.yml`
- Disables blank issues (encourages template usage)
- Provides helpful links:
  - 📚 Documentation
  - 💬 Discussions

---

## Usage

When users click "New Issue" on GitHub, they will see:
1. Eight template options (6 strategic + 2 general)
2. Two helpful resource links
3. No blank issue option

Each template guides users to provide:
- Clear categorization (which sub-area)
- Problem statement (current vs desired)
- Proposed solution with code examples
- Real-world use cases
- Context about current capabilities
- Strategic alignment notes

✅ All 6 main categories have dedicated templates
✅ All sub-features within categories are represented
✅ Additional bug and general templates for completeness
✅ Documentation (README.md) for template usage
