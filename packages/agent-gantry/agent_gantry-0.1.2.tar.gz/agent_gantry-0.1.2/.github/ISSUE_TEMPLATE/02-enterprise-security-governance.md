## Context: Current Security Features

Agent-Gantry currently provides:
- ✅ Zero-Trust architecture with capability-based permissions
- ✅ Circuit breakers for automatic failure detection
- ✅ Tool-level health tracking and observability

This feature request aims to enhance compliance and governance capabilities.

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Protocol
- **Goal**: Standardized hook for "Sensitive Tools" requiring human approval
- **Example**: Instead of executing `delete_production_db` immediately, return `PendingApproval` status requiring secondary confirmation
- **Benefit**: Prevent catastrophic actions through mandatory human oversight

### PII Redaction / DLP
- **Goal**: Middleware to automatically detect and redact sensitive information
- **Example**: Strip credit cards, API keys, PII from tool inputs/outputs before logging to telemetry
- **Benefit**: Compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other data protection regulations

### Rate Limiting & Quotas
- **Goal**: Per-tool or per-user rate limits
- **Example**: "The `send_sms` tool can only be called 10 times per hour"
- **Benefit**: Prevent abuse, control costs, and ensure fair resource usage

## Compliance Requirements
<!-- List any specific compliance standards this feature would help meet -->
- [ ] GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- [ ] HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- [ ] SOC 2
- [ ] ISO 27001
- [ ] PCI DSS
- [ ] Other:
