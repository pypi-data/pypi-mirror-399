**Example Scenario:**


**Expected Benefit:**


## Context: Current Architecture

Currently, Agent-Gantry excels at "Flat" Semantic Retrieval (finding the best tool for a query). This feature request aims to expand beyond that foundation.

### Hierarchical / Domain Routing
- **Goal**: As tool counts grow from 100 to 10,000, implement a "Router of Routers" pattern
- **Example**: First route to "Finance Domain", then to "Tax Calculator"
- **Benefit**: Improved scalability and reduced noise in vector search

### Tool Chaining / Pipelines
- **Goal**: Support Atomic Workflows—pre-defined chains of tools exposed as a single "Meta-Tool"
- **Example**: `onboard_employee` executes `create_email` → `create_slack` → `send_welcome`
- **Benefit**: Reduce LLM complexity by handling multi-step workflows internally

### Parameter-Aware Routing
- **Goal**: Enhance router to check Contextual Feasibility beyond semantic similarity
- **Example**: If a tool requires `order_id` and no such entity exists in conversation history, penalize that tool's score
- **Benefit**: More accurate tool selection based on available context

**Note**: This feature aligns with the strategic roadmap for scaling Agent-Gantry to handle enterprise-scale tool inventories and complex orchestration patterns.
