- [ ] Simulation & Replay (Snapshot Testing)
- [ ] Visualization Tools
- [ ] Debugging Tools
- [ ] Other DX Enhancement

## Problem Statement
<!-- Describe the current DX limitation this feature would solve -->

**Current Behavior:**
<!-- What developer workflow exists today? -->

**Desired Behavior:**
<!-- What improved workflow should exist? -->

## Proposed Solution

### Overview
<!-- High-level description of your proposed solution -->

### User Interface
<!-- If this involves a UI, describe the interface or provide mockups -->

### Technical Details
<!-- Technical implementation details, if applicable -->

### Example Usage
<!-- Provide examples or screenshots showing how this would work -->

```python
# Example usage or CLI command
```

## Use Case
<!-- Describe a real-world developer workflow this would improve -->

**Example Scenario:**


**Expected Benefit:**


## Context: Current Developer Tools

Agent-Gantry currently provides:
- ✅ CLI for listing and searching tools (`agent-gantry list`, `agent-gantry search`)
- ✅ Structured logging and telemetry
- ✅ OpenTelemetry integration for tracing

This feature request aims to enhance the developer experience with additional tooling.

### Gantry Dashboard (Web UI)
- **Goal**: Lightweight local web server for development and debugging
- **Technology**: Streamlit, FastUI, or similar
- **Features**:
  - Visualize the Vector Space (see how tools cluster)
  - Monitor Circuit Breaker status (manually reset tripped breakers)
  - View Traces/Logs in real-time
  - Manually test tools without an LLM
  - Inspect tool registrations and metadata
  - Performance metrics and health dashboard

### Simulation & Replay
- **Goal**: Record and replay tool execution sessions for testing
- **Features**:
  - Record a session of tool executions
  - Replay sessions against new tool code
  - Detect regressions (Snapshot Testing for Agents)
  - Compare behavior before/after changes
- **Use Case**: Ensure tool changes don't break existing agent workflows

### Visualization Tools
- **Ideas**:
  - Tool similarity heatmaps
  - Routing decision trees
  - Token usage analytics
  - Tool execution timelines

### Debugging Tools
- **Ideas**:
  - Interactive tool tester
  - Schema validator
  - Embedding inspector
  - Query analyzer (why was this tool ranked high/low?)

## UI/UX Considerations
