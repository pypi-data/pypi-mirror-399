**Marteo** (pronounced _MAR-TI-OH_) is a CLI tool designed to bring the ease of modern scaffolding to the C++ ecosystem. It eliminates boilerplate fatigue by generating professional, CMake-based project structures with a single command.

Stop writing `CMakeLists.txt` from scratch. Let Marteo handle the architecture while you focus on the code.
