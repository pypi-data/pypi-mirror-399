# cf53

A human-oriented cloudflare DNS updater. This provide a way to IaC cloudflare DNS records with a simple toml file, and get a good visual feedback of the diffs to make it actual.

Think terraform, but smarter. No need to keep a local state or copy/paste ids around, just say what records you want, provide an API token, that's it.
