    Service for cleaning up conversation history records.

    Implements session-based LRU cleanup strategy:
    - Maintains session limit by removing least recently used sessions
    - Runs immediately when new sessions are created and limit is exceeded

    LRU vs FIFO for Better User Experience:
    - LRU (Least Recently Used): Keeps sessions that users are actively using,
      even if they're old
    - FIFO (First In, First Out): Would remove oldest sessions regardless of
      recent activity
    - LRU provides better UX because active conversations are preserved longer

    Note: Per-session FIFO cleanup (max 20 records) is handled by the SQLite provider.
