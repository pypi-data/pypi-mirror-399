## Getting Started

Follow the [install instructions](#installation), then see [usage](#usage).

## Requirements

All popular Linux distributions with `Python 3.8` or later are currently supported.

If you're on Linux and you find `open-latest-screenshot` doesn't work on your distro, please [open a new issue here](https://gitlab.com/DrTexx/open-latest-screenshot/-/issues).

## Installation

```bash
pip install openlatestscreenshot
```

## Usage

```bash
open-latest-screenshot
```

### Keyboard Shortcut Setup

If you find yourself using `open-latest-screenshot` a lot, it's recommended to set a **custom keyboard shortcut** to launch the script. Many popular Linux desktop environments allow you to do this easily.

### Gnome Keyboard Shortcut Setup
1. Open GNOME settings
2. Navigate to `Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Customize Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts`
3. Click the `Add Shortcut` button
4. Set the `name`, `command` and `shortcut` to the following:
   - `name`: `Open latest screenshot`
   - `command`: `open-latest-screenshot`
   - `shortcut`: Whatever you like!
5. Done!

**TIP:** If the keyboard shortcut doesn't seem to be working, make sure to test that `open-latest-screenshot` is working as expected from your terminal, as GNOME won't let you know if an error has occured.

## Development

### Installation (for Developers)

```bash
cd "<repo_root_dir>"
poetry install
```

### Usage (for Developers)

```bash
cd "<repo_root_dir>"
poetry run open-latest-screenshot
```

### Generating Coverage Reports Locally

```bash
cd "<repo_root_dir>"
./development-scripts/generate-html-coverage-report.sh  # generate HTML coverage report
start "htmlcov/index.html"  # open coverage report in default browser
```

**Important Note:** Coverage results will only be updated each time the `generate-html-coverage-report.sh` script is run. If you've added/updated tests but your coverage hasn't changed, make sure that you haven't forgotten to rerun the script.

### Build/Test

Builds and tests are automated by GitLab pipelines!

Just [create a merge request](https://gitlab.com/DrTexx/open-latest-screenshot/-/merge_requests/new) and everything should happen automatically ⚙️ ✅
