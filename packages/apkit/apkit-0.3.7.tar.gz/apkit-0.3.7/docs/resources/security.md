# Security Policy

The `apkit` team takes security seriously and is committed to **responsible disclosure**. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Supported Versions

As a small, open-source project, our resources are limited. Therefore, we can only provide security patches for the most recent version of `apkit`. Please ensure you are using the latest version before submitting a report.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in `apkit` or any of its related projects (`apmodel`, `apsig`), please report it to us privately.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an private report from https://github.com/fedi-libs/apkit/security. (To reduce the burden, please do not use the previously designated reporting destination as the reporting destination.)

Please include the following details with your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any proof-of-concept code.

## Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report as soon as possible.
- We will work with you to understand and validate the issue.
- We will work to release a patch in a timely manner.

We thank you for helping to keep `apkit` and its users safe.
