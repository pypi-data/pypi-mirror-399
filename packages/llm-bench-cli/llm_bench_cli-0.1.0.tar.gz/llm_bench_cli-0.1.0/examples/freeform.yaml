# Freeform mode: When test cases have only 'input' (no expected, regex, or validator),
# the benchmark displays raw outputs for manual inspection instead of pass/fail results.
# This is useful for:
# - Comparing how different models respond to the same prompt
# - Evaluating response style, tone, or creativity
# - Exploring model capabilities before defining validation criteria
