# ContextFS Development Guidelines

## Git Workflow (GitFlow)
Always follow GitFlow for changes:
1. Create a new branch for changes (feature/*, bugfix/*, hotfix/*)
2. Make changes on the feature branch
3. **Validate work before committing** (run relevant tests, verify functionality)
4. Create PR to merge into main
5. Never commit directly to main

## Testing Requirements
**Each feature must have a test. Tests must pass locally before committing.**

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/integration/test_autoindex.py -x -q

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=contextfs
```

### Test Guidelines
1. **Every new feature needs a test** - No exceptions
2. **Run tests locally before committing** - Avoid CI failures
3. **Tests must work without optional dependencies** - Use `auto` mode for embedding backend
4. **Fix failing tests before pushing** - Don't break the build

### Common CI Failures to Avoid
- **FastEmbed not installed**: Use `embedding_backend: str = "auto"` (falls back to sentence_transformers)
- **Missing test fixtures**: Ensure pytest fixtures are properly scoped
- **Database state**: Tests should be isolated, use temp directories

## Validation Before Commit
Before committing any changes:
1. Run relevant tests: `pytest tests/` or specific test files
2. Verify the fix/feature works as expected
3. Check for regressions in related functionality

## Search Strategy
Always search contextfs memories FIRST before searching code directly:
1. Use `contextfs_search` to find relevant memories
2. Only search code with Glob/Grep if memories don't have the answer
3. The repo is self-indexed - semantic search can find code snippets

## Database Changes
- Core tables (memories, sessions): Use Alembic migrations in `src/contextfs/migrations/`
- Index tables (index_status, indexed_files, indexed_commits): Managed by AutoIndexer._init_db() directly, no migration needed

## Documentation in Memory
**When adding new features, always save to contextfs memory:**
1. After implementing a new CLI command, MCP tool, or API endpoint, save to memory with type `api`
2. Use `contextfs_evolve` on memory ID `f9b4bb25` (API reference) to update the complete endpoint list
3. Include: endpoint/command name, parameters, and brief description
4. This keeps the API reference memory up-to-date for future sessions
