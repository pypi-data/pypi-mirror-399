"""
pyfwg: Python Future Weather Generator

This file serves as the main entry point for the pyfwg package.
It handles the initial setup, such as configuring the logging system with
optional color support, and it defines the public API by importing the key
classes, functions, and constants from the various modules. This allows users
to access all primary features directly from the top-level `pyfwg` import.

# --- Colored Logging Configuration ---
# This block attempts to configure colored logging using the 'colorlog' library.
# If 'colorlog' is not installed, it gracefully falls back to the standard,
# non-colored logging setup, ensuring the library remains functional.

    logger = colorlog.getLogger()

    # If the logger already has handlers (e.g., from an interactive console like
    # IPython or Jupyter), we remove them to ensure a clean slate. This makes
    # our custom colored handler the one and only handler.
    if logger.hasHandlers():
        logger.handlers.clear()

    # This check prevents adding duplicate handlers in some environments (e.g., Jupyter).
