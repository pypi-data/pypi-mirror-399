  # Gnosari AI Workforce
  
  📚 **[Documentation](https://docs.gnosari.com)**
</div>

**Gnosari AI Workforce** is a powerful framework for orchestrating multi-agent teams using Large Language Models. Create intelligent AI agent swarms that collaborate through streaming delegation and dynamic tool discovery.

## What is Gnosari AI Workforce?

Gnosari AI Workforce enables you to build sophisticated multi-agent systems where AI agents can:

- 🤝 **Delegate tasks** to specialized agents in real-time
- 🔧 **Discover and use tools** dynamically through MCP servers
- 📚 **Query knowledge bases** for context-aware responses
- 🌐 **Make API calls** to external services
- 🗄️ **Query databases** for data-driven decisions
- 📊 **Stream responses** for real-time collaboration

## Key Features

### Multi-Provider LLM Support
Each agent can use different models from various providers:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o, etc.)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- DeepSeek
- Google (Gemini)
- And more...

### Task Delegation & Handoffs
Agents can both delegate tasks and transfer control with configurable instructions:
- **Delegation**: Use the delegate_agent tool to send tasks to other agents and get their responses
- **Handoffs**: Transfer control to other agents when they should take over the conversation
- **Configurable Instructions**: Specify exactly when and how agents should delegate or transfer control
- **Auto-Tool Injection**: The delegate_agent tool is automatically added when delegation is configured

### Agent Personality Traits
Give your agents unique personalities with the comprehensive traits system:
- **Personality Traits**: Configure traits like "funny", "serious", "analytical", "helpful", and more
- **Weight-Based Control**: Fine-tune trait intensity with weight values (0.0 to 2.0)
- **Natural Expression**: Traits flow naturally through agent responses without forcing behavior
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatic warnings for conflicting trait combinations
- **Rich Prompts**: Trait instructions are dynamically integrated into agent system prompts

### Tool Integration
- Built-in tools (delegate_agent, api_request, knowledge_query, mysql_query, website_content, file_operations)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
- Dynamic tool discovery

### Knowledge Bases
Embedchain integration for RAG capabilities with support for:
- Websites
- YouTube videos
- Documents
- And more...

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.12+** installed on your system
- **Poetry** for dependency management
- **API Keys** for the LLM providers you want to use

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neomanex/gnosari-engine.git
cd gnosari-engine
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
poetry install
```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
# OpenAI (required for most examples)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Optional: Other providers
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-key
```

### Your First Team

Create a file called `my-first-team.yaml`:

```yaml
name: My First Team

# Define tools for the team
tools:
  - name: delegate_agent
    module: gnosari.tools.delegate_agent
    class: DelegateAgentTool
    args:
      pass

# Define agents
agents:
  - name: Coordinator
    instructions: >
      You are a helpful coordinator who manages tasks and delegates work to specialists.
      When you receive a request, analyze it and delegate to the appropriate specialist.
      Always provide a summary of the work completed.
    orchestrator: true
    model: gpt-4o
    tools:
      - delegate_agent

  - name: Writer
    instructions: >
      You are a professional writer who creates clear, engaging content.
      When given a writing task, focus on clarity, structure, and engaging the reader.
      Always ask for clarification if the requirements are unclear.
    model: gpt-4o

  - name: Researcher
    instructions: >
      You are a thorough researcher who gathers and analyzes information.
      When given a research task, provide comprehensive, well-sourced information.
      Always cite your sources and note any limitations in the information.
    model: gpt-4o
```

### Run Your Team

```bash
# Run entire team
poetry run gnosari --config "my-first-team.yaml" --message "Write a blog post about the benefits of renewable energy"

# Run specific agent
poetry run gnosari --config "my-first-team.yaml" --message "Research renewable energy trends" --agent "Researcher"

# With streaming output
poetry run gnosari --config "my-first-team.yaml" --message "Your message" --stream

# With debug mode
poetry run gnosari --config "my-first-team.yaml" --message "Your message" --debug
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Session Configuration

Gnosari supports persistent conversation memory through a custom `GnosariContextSession` implementation that extends the OpenAI Agents SDK session functionality. This custom implementation provides enhanced context storage, multi-backend support, and API integration capabilities. Configure session persistence using environment variables:

#### Environment Variables

- **`SESSION_PROVIDER`**: Session storage provider (default: `file`)
  - `file`: SQLite file-based storage (suitable for development and single-instance deployments)
  - `database`: External database storage (suitable for production and multi-instance deployments)  
  - `gnosari_api`: API-based distributed storage (suitable for distributed deployments)

- **`SESSION_DATABASE_URL`**: Database connection URL (required for `database` provider)
- **`GNOSARI_API_BASE_URL`**: Base URL for API provider (required for `gnosari_api`)
- **`GNOSARI_API_KEY`**: Authentication key for API provider (required for `gnosari_api`)

#### File-Based Sessions (Default)

For development and simple deployments, sessions are stored in local SQLite files:

```bash
# Optional: Specify custom SQLite file location
export SESSION_PROVIDER=file
export SESSION_DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///my_conversations.db

# Run your team with session persistence
poetry run gnosari --config "team.yaml" --message "Hello" --session-id "user-123"
```

**Supported SQLite URLs:**
- `sqlite+aiosqlite:///conversations.db` (relative path)
- `sqlite+aiosqlite:////absolute/path/to/conversations.db` (absolute path)
- `sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:` (in-memory database)

#### Database-Based Sessions

For production deployments with multiple instances, use external databases:

```bash
# PostgreSQL (Recommended for production)
export SESSION_PROVIDER=database
export SESSION_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://username:password@localhost:5432/gnosari_sessions

# MySQL/MariaDB
export SESSION_PROVIDER=database
export SESSION_DATABASE_URL=mysql+aiomysql://username:password@localhost:3306/gnosari_sessions

# Run your team with persistent sessions
poetry run gnosari --config "team.yaml" --message "Hello" --session-id "user-123"
```

**Supported Database URLs:**

| Database | URL Format | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **PostgreSQL** | `postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host:port/db` | Recommended for production |
| **MySQL** | `mysql+aiomysql://user:pass@host:port/db` | Good alternative for production |
| **SQLite** | `sqlite+aiosqlite:///path/to/file.db` | Development and single-instance |

#### API-Based Sessions

For distributed deployments, sessions can be stored via the Gnosari API backend:

```bash
# API-based sessions (distributed storage)
export SESSION_PROVIDER=gnosari_api
export GNOSARI_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001
export GNOSARI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Run your team with API-backed persistent sessions
poetry run gnosari --config "team.yaml" --message "Hello" --session-id "user-123"
```

**API Session Features:**
- **Distributed**: Multiple engine instances share session storage
- **Context Aware**: Automatically stores account, team, and agent context
- **REST API**: Uses standard HTTP REST API for session operations  
- **Authentication**: Secured with API key authentication
- **Fallback Ready**: Can fall back to local storage if API is unavailable

#### Database Setup

For external databases, ensure the session tables exist before running:

1. **Create the database** (if it doesn't exist)
2. **Run migrations** using your database migration tool, or
3. **Create tables manually**:

```sql
-- PostgreSQL/MySQL
CREATE TABLE agent_sessions (
    session_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE agent_messages (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    message_data TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES agent_sessions(session_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX idx_agent_messages_session_time ON agent_messages(session_id, created_at);
```

#### Session Usage

Sessions enable conversation continuity across multiple interactions:

```bash
# First conversation
poetry run gnosari --config "team.yaml" --message "My name is Alice" --session-id "user-123"

# Later conversation (remembers previous context)  
poetry run gnosari --config "team.yaml" --message "What's my name?" --session-id "user-123"
```
