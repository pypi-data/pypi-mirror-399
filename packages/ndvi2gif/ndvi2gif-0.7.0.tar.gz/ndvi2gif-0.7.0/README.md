**Ndvi2Gif** is a Python library designed to simplify access to global satellite data through the Google Earth Engine platform. While its name highlights the ability to create seasonal GIF animations, the true power of this tool lies in its capability to compute and export pixel-wise statistics for any region on Earth, across any time span covered by supported remote sensing datasets.

Built on top of [Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/google/earthengine-api) and [Geemap](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap), it allows you to:

- Generate annual or multi-annual composited rasters (e.g., median NDVI per season between 2001 and 2020),
- Apply multiple statistics (mean, max, flexible percentiles) across space and time,
- Export results as GeoTIFFs for further analysis,
- Retrieve zonal statistics over user-defined geometries,
- Monitor vegetation structure with advanced SAR indices,
- Handle incomplete years automatically for real-time monitoring,
- **NEW in v0.6.0:** Perform supervised and unsupervised land cover classification with integrated machine learning,
- **NEW in v0.6.0:** Export directly to Google Drive and Earth Engine Assets,
- And yes — also create colorful GIFs for easy visualization.

Whether you're monitoring crop phenology, detecting harvest events, assessing drought trends, classifying land cover, or preparing input layers for further ecological modeling, `ndvi2gif` makes it easier to extract reliable, multi-temporal remote sensing information at scale.

Ndvi2Gif was updated and extended as part of its integration into the eLTER and SUMHAL projects, which also enabled the use of eLTER site boundaries (via `deimsPy`) as one of its input sources.

## ✨ What's New in v0.7.0 - Climate Data Integration Release 🌡️

The **0.7.0 release** expands *Ndvi2Gif* beyond vegetation monitoring into comprehensive **climate analysis** with ERA5-Land reanalysis (47 variables, 1950-present) and CHIRPS precipitation (1981-present). The library now supports **88 variables across 7 platforms** with intelligent handling of climate vs. vegetation data in time series analysis.

### 🌡️ Key Features in v0.7.0

- **ERA5-Land Climate Reanalysis**: 47 variables including temperature (with min/max/Celsius variants), precipitation (meters and L/m²), soil moisture, radiation, wind, and snow
- **CHIRPS Precipitation**: High-resolution daily rainfall (1981-present, ~5.5km) combining satellite + station data
- **Enhanced Statistics**: New `sum` and `min` aggregators for climate data
- **Smart Time Series**: Climate-specific dashboards with seasonal statistics (replaces phenology for non-vegetation data)
- **Bug Fixes**: `end_year` now inclusive, Sentinel-3 band naming fixed, ROI centroid error resolved

## Why use Ndvi2Gif?

Unlike many visualization-oriented tools, Ndvi2Gif is designed as a **remote sensing analytics suite** that abstracts much of the complexity of working directly with Google Earth Engine, while giving you the flexibility to go far beyond GIF creation.

You can:

- **Access pixel-wise statistics** over any Earth location, at any scale and time span.  
  - Example: *Obtain the monthly median of the 85th NDVI percentile per pixel from 1984 to 2024 using Landsat data.*  
  - Example: *Calculate the maximum of the seasonal NDWI maximums between 2017 and 2023 using Sentinel-2.*  
  - Example: *Monitor crop harvest timing with bi-monthly VV/VH ratio analysis using Sentinel-1.*  
  - Example: *Track daily algal blooms with Sentinel-3 OLCI turbidity indices.*  

- **Perform advanced machine learning classification** (NEW in v0.6.0):
  - Multi-temporal land cover mapping with Random Forest
  - Crop type classification with SVM
  - Unsupervised clustering with K-means
  - Feature importance analysis for ecological insights

- **Perform nested aggregations**:  
  First compute temporal summaries (e.g., per-season percentiles or means), then apply a second statistical reduction across years (e.g., median, min, max).

- **Run advanced time series analysis** with the `TimeSeriesAnalyzer`:  
  - Trend detection (Mann-Kendall, Sen's slope, linear regression)  
  - Multi-panel dashboards (seasonal patterns, autocorrelation, data quality)  
  - Phenology metrics such as Start/End of Season, Peak, Length, amplitude, and rates of change  

- **Preprocess Sentinel-1 SAR like a pro** with the `S1ARDProcessor`:  
  - Radiometric terrain correction for mountainous regions  
  - Multiple speckle filtering options (Boxcar, Lee, Refined Lee, Gamma-MAP, Lee Sigma)  
  - Flexible DEM support (Copernicus and SRTM)  

- **Target any ecological or phenological metric** by choosing the appropriate index and analysis pipeline.

- **Work globally**, without needing to download or preprocess raw satellite data — all computations are handled via Earth Engine's cloud infrastructure.

- **Handle real-time monitoring** with automatic detection of available data periods for incomplete years.

In other words: if you can describe a temporal range, a spatial region, an index, and a chain of statistics — `ndvi2gif` can not only generate it, but now also help you **classify, analyze and interpret the changes over time**.

Yes, it makes nice GIFs — but it's much more than that.

You can combine any of the supported indices, datasets, and statistical methods. By default, the tool uses NDVI with the **maximum** statistic to avoid cloud contamination. However, **median** and **custom percentiles** are often visually better for Landsat datasets and specific applications.

Note: **Sentinel-2** uses Surface Reflectance, **Sentinel-3** uses Level-1B TOA radiance (optimized for aquatic applications), while **Landsat and MODIS** use Surface Reflectance (SR) for superior atmospheric correction and scientific quality.

The tool generates rasters with 4 (seasons), 12 (months), or 24 (custom periods) bands per year.

Beyond creating a nice-looking animated GIF, this multi-seasonal compositing method provides insights into vegetation dynamics, phenology, land cover, and more. High values in all seasons (white tones) typically mean perennial vegetation, while low values (dark tones) might represent water, soil, or impervious surfaces.

## GeoTIFF Export

You can also export seasonal composites as GeoTIFF files for further analysis. Multi-year composites are supported as well. For example, you can export median NDVI per season for all of Africa between 2001–2020, bi-monthly VV/VH ratios for crop monitoring, or daily Sentinel-3 turbidity indices for water quality assessment.
