"<strong>The total amount of the imported invoice is %(real_amount_total)s "
"whereas the total amount computed by Odoo is %(current_amount_total)s</"
"strong>. It is the consequence of a difference between the total tax amount "
"of the invoice (%(real_amount_tax)s) and the total tax amount computed by "
"Odoo (%(current_amount_tax)s). This is often caused by missing taxes in "
"invoice lines due to a failure to find the tax in Odoo that correspond to "
"the tax in the imported invoice or missing configuration of taxes on "
"products or missing configuration of <em>Default Taxes</em> on the partner "
"(if there are no products on invoice lines)."
