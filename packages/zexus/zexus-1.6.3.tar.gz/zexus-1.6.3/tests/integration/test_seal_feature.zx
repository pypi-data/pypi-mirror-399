# Test Seal Feature
# Test 1: Seal a simple variable
let x = 42
seal x
print x  # Should print 42

# This assignment should fail (attempting to modify sealed object)
# Uncomment to test error handling:
# x = 100

# Test 2: Seal a map
let myMap = {name: "Alice", age: 30}
seal myMap
print myMap  # Should print {name: Alice, age: 30}

# Test 3: Working with sealed lists
let arr = [1, 2, 3]
seal arr
print arr  # Should print [1, 2, 3]

print "Seal tests passed!"
