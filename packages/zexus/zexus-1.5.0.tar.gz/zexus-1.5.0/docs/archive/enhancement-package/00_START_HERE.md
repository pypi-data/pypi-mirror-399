- **`audit`** - Log all data access for compliance
- **`restrict`** - Field-level access control
- **`sandbox`** - Isolated execution environments

### ⚡ Performance (5 features)
- **`native`** - Call C/C++ code directly
- **`gc`** - Control garbage collection
- **`inline`** - Function inlining optimization
- **`buffer`** - Direct memory access
- **`simd`** - Vector operations (SIMD instructions)

### 🎯 Convenience (4 features)
- **`const`** - Immutable variables (implementing now)
- **`elif`** - Else-if conditionals (implementing now)
- **`defer`** - Cleanup code execution
- **`pattern`** - Pattern matching expressions

### 📊 Advanced (3 features)
- **`enum`** - Type-safe enumerations
- **`stream`** - Event streaming
- **`watch`** - Reactive state management
