# Example: Simple run() usage
# Demonstrates keeping a program running indefinitely

print("🚀 Starting continuous program...")
print("This program will keep running until you press Ctrl+C")
print("")

# Option 1: run() without callback - just keeps program alive
# run()

# Option 2: run() with callback - execute code periodically
let counter = 0

action tick() {
    counter = counter + 1
    print("⏰ Tick " + string(counter))
}

# Call tick() every 1 second
run(tick, 1)
