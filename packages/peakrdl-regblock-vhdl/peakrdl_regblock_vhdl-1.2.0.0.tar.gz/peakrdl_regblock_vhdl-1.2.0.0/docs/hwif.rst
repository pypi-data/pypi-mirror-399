Hardware Interface
------------------

The generated register block will present the entire hardware interface to the user
using two record ports:

* ``hwif_in``
* ``hwif_out``

All field inputs and outputs as well as signals are consolidated into these
record ports. The presence of each depends on the specific contents of the design
being exported.


Using records for the hardware interface has the following benefits:

* Preserves register map component grouping, arrays, and hierarchy.
* Avoids naming collisions and cumbersome signal name flattening.
* Allows for more natural mapping and distribution of register block signals to a design's hardware components.
* Use of arrays/records prevents common assignment mistakes as they are enforced by the compiler.


Records are organized as follows: ``hwif_out.<heir_path>.<feature>``

For example, a simple design such as:

.. code-block:: systemrdl

        addrmap my_design {
            reg {
                field {
                    sw = rw;
                    hw = rw;
                    we;
                } my_field;
            } my_reg[2];
        };

... results in the following record members:

.. code-block:: text

    hwif_out.my_reg(0).my_field.value
    hwif_in.my_reg(0).my_field.next_q
    hwif_in.my_reg(0).my_field.we
    hwif_out.my_reg(1).my_field.value
    hwif_in.my_reg(1).my_field.next_q
    hwif_in.my_reg(1).my_field.we

For brevity in this documentation, hwif features will be described using shorthand
notation that omits the hierarchical path: ``hwif_out..<feature>``


.. important::

    The PeakRDL tool makes no guarantees on the field order of the hwif structs.
    For this reason, it is strongly recommended to always access struct members
    directly, by name.

    If using the SystemVerilog streaming operator to assign the hwif struct to a
    packed vector, be extremely careful to avoid assumptions on the resulting bit-position of a field.
