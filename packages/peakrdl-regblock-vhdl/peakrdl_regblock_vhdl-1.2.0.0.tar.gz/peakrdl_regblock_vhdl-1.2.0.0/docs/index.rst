Introduction
============

PeakRDL-regblock-vhdl is a free and open-source control & status register (CSR) compiler.
This code generator translates your SystemRDL register description into
a synthesizable VHDL RTL module that can be easily instantiated into
your hardware design.

* Generates fully synthesizable VHDL RTL (IEEE 1076-2008)
* Options for many popular CPU interface protocols (AMBA APB, AXI4-Lite, and more)
* Configurable pipelining options for designs with fast clock rates.
* Broad support for SystemRDL 2.0 features


Quick Start
-----------
The easiest way to use PeakRDL-regblock-vhdl is via the  `PeakRDL command line tool <https://peakrdl.readthedocs.io/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install PeakRDL-regblock-vhdl along with the command-line tool
    python3 -m pip install peakrdl-regblock-vhdl[cli]

    # Export!
    peakrdl regblock-vhdl atxmega_spi.rdl -o regblock/ --cpuif axi4-lite

Depending on the chosen CPU interface, the generated RTL may rely on VHDL packages
available in the `hdl_src folder in the repository <https://github.com/SystemRDL/PeakRDL-regblock-vhdl/tree/main/src/peakrdl_regblock_vhdl/hdl_src>`_.

Looking for SystemVerilog?
--------------------------
This project generates VHDL RTL. If you prefer using SystemVerilog, check out
the upstream project from which this exporter was forked:
`PeakRDL-regblock <https://peakrdl-regblock.readthedocs.io>`_
