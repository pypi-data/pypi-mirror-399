    """
    Abstract base class for database isolation strategies.

    Isolation strategies control how data is filtered to ensure
    tenant isolation. Implementations can use:
    - PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS)
    - Application-level query filtering
    - A combination of both (hybrid)

    Subclasses must implement:
    - setup_session: Configure database session for isolation
    - apply_query_filters: Add tenant/team filters to queries
    - verify_record_access: Check if a record is accessible

    Usage:
        class MyStrategy(IsolationStrategy):
            async def setup_session(self, session):
                # Configure session for RLS
                pass

            def apply_query_filters(self, query, model_class, **options):
                # Add WHERE clauses for tenant isolation
                return query.where(model_class.tenant_id == ctx.tenant_id)
    """

        This is called at the beginning of each request/operation to set
        up any session-level variables needed for isolation (e.g., RLS).

        Args:
            session: SQLAlchemy async session to configure

        Raises:
            TenantContextError: If tenant context is not set
