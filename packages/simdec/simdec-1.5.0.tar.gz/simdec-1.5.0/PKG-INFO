**Simulation decomposition** or **SimDec** is an uncertainty and sensitivity
analysis method, which is based on Monte Carlo simulation. SimDec consists of
three major parts:

1. computing sensitivity indices,
2. creating multi-variable scenarios and mapping the output values to them, and
3. visualizing the scenarios on the output distribution by color-coding its segments.

SimDec reveals the nature of causalities and interaction effects in the model.
