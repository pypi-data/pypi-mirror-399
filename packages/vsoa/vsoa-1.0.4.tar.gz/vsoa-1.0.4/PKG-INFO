# Overview
VSOA is the abbreviation of Vehicle SOA presented by ACOINFO, VSOA provides a reliable, Real-Time SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) framework, this framework has multi-language and multi-environment implementation, developers can use this framework to build a distributed service model. 

VSOA includes the following features:
1. Support resource tagging of unified URL
1. Support URL matching subscribe and publish model
1. Support Real-Time Remote Procedure Call
1. Support parallel multiple command sequences
1. Support reliable and unreliable data publishing and datagram
1. Support multi-channel full-duplex high speed parallel data streams
1. Support network QoS control
1. Easily implement server fault-tolerant design
1. Supports multiple language bindings
1. Support work queue mechanism
1. Support TLS encrypted connection
1. Support client robot

VSOA is a dual-channel communication protocol, using both **TCP** and **UDP**, among which the API marked with `quick` uses the **UDP** channel. The quick channel is used for high-frequency data update channels. Due to the high data update frequency, the requirements for communication reliability are not strict. It should be noted that **UDP** channel cannot pass through NAT network, so please do not use quick channel in NAT network.

The total url and payload length of the VSOA data packet cannot exceed **256KBytes - 20Bytes** and **65507Bytes - 20Bytes** on quick channel, so if you need to send a large amount of data, you can use the VSOA data stream.

User can use the following code to import the `vsoa` module.
``` python
import vsoa
```

> Python minimum version requirement 3.10, recommended >= 3.12.

# VSOA Server Class
## vsoa.Server(info: dict | str = '', passwd: str = '', raw: bool = False)
+ `info` This server information.
+ `passwd` This server password.
+ `raw` Whether RPC and DATAGRAM `payload.param` automatically perform JSON parsing.
+ Returns: VSOA server object.

Create a VSOA server.

``` python
server = vsoa.Server('VSOA python server')
```

# VSOA Server Object
## server.clients() -> list[RemoteClient]
+ Returns: List of clients.

Get list of clients currently connected to this server.

``` python
for cli in server.clients():
	print(cli.id) # Print remote client ID
```

## server.address() -> tuple[str, int]
+ Returns: Server address tuple.

Get the server address currently bound to this server. Exception will be thrown when the server is not started.

``` python
addr, port = server.address()
```

## server.passwd(passwd: str = '')
+ `passwd` New password.

Set a new password for the server, `None` or `''` mean no password.

**NOTICE**: The password is just a string without any secure encryption, therefore, it is only a relatively simple security management.

## server.getpeercert(binary: bool = False) -> dict | None

- `binary`  information format,Default  False.

Get the peer certificate information.

When binary is set to True, the method returns the certificate in binary form, which can be used in specific situations where the certificate data needs to be saved intact and passed to other underlying functions that may require input in binary format for further processing.

When binary is set to False, this method returns a data structure of type dict that contains many details about the certificate,commonly as follows:

- `"version"`  Version number of the certificate.
- `"serialNumber"` Serial number of certificate.
- `"subject"` Certificate subject information.
- `"issuer"` Certificate issuer information.
- `"notBefore"` Start validity period of the certificate.
- `"notAfter"` Expiration date of the certificate.

There are also some other information such as public key related information, extension information, etc. Different certificates may have more detailed content in these aspects.

## server.publish(url: str, payload: vsoa.Payload | dict = None, quick: bool = False) -> bool
+ `url` Publish URL.
+ `payload` Payload data.
+ `quick` Whether to use quick mode.
+ Returns: Whether publish is successful.

Publish a message, all clients subscribed to this URL will receive this message. If a large number of high-frequency releases are required and delivery is not guaranteed, the `quick` parameter can be set to `True`.

The `payload` object contains the following members:
+ `param`: *{object | dict | list | str | bytes | bytearray}* Parameters of this RPC request. Optional.
+ `data` *{bytes | bytearray}* Data for this publish. Optional.

URL matching: URL uses `'/'` as a separator, for example: `'/a/b/c'`, if the client subscribes to `'/a/'`, the server publish `'/a'`, `'/a/b'` or `'/a/b/c'` message, the client will be received.

``` python
server.publish('/a/b/c')
server.publish('/a/b/c', { 'param': { 'hello': 'hello' } })
server.publish('/a/b/c', { 'param': { 'hello': 'hello' }, 'data': bytes([1, 2, 3]) })

# Or
server.publish('/a/b/c', vsoa.Payload({ 'hello': 'hello' }))
server.publish('/a/b/c', vsoa.Payload({ 'hello': 'hello' }, bytes([1, 2, 3])))
```

**NOTICE：**The URL must start with '/', otherwise an exception will be generated.

## server.is_subscribed(url: str) -> bool
+ `url` Publish URL.
+ Returns: Whether the specified URL is subscribed by clients.

Whether the specified URL is subscribed. When the return value is `True`, it means that the specified URL is subscribed by at least one client.

## server.command(url: str, wq: vsoa:WorkQueue = None) -> callable
+ `url` RPC command URL.
+ `wq` This command function runs in the specified workqueue.

Server RPC command entry registration decorator.

``` python
server = vsoa.Server('VSOA python server')

@server.command('/echo')
def echo(cli, request, payload):
	cli.reply(request.seqno, payload) # echo reply

server.run('0.0.0.0', 3005)
```

## server.sendtimeout(timeout: float, sync_to_clis: bool = True)
+ `timeout` Send timeout.
+ `sync_to_clis` Whether set send timeout to the connected clients.

Set send timeout, default is `0.1`. (100ms), if` sync_to_clis` is set to True, it will also set the send timeout for already connected clients.

## server.run(host: str, port: int, sslopt: dict = None)
+ `host` Local address.
+ `port` Local port.
+ `sslopt` TLS connection options, Optional. Default is `None`.

Start the server and execute the event loop. This function does not return when no errors occur.

### one-way authentication sslopt

#### server sslopt

``` python
def sni_callback(sock, server_hostname, sslcontext):
	return server_hostname

sslopt = {
	'cert': 'server.crt',
	'key': 'server.key',
	'load_default_certs': False,
	'sni_callback': sni_callback,
	'verify_mode': ssl.CERT_REQUIRED,
	'handsake_error_log': True,
	'passwd': None
}
```

+ `cert` Server certificate file path.
+ `key` Server  private key file path.
+ `load_default_certs` Whether to load the default system certificate. When set to `True`, Python's SSL module attempts to load some of the trusted certificates configured by the system default. if you are connecting to a server that issues certificates using a self-signed certificate or a private CA, you may need to configure additional certificate-related options (such as via ca_cert, etc.) to ensure that the authentication passes.
+ `sni_callback` SNI is an extension mechanism in the SSL/TLS protocol that allows the client to indicate to the server at the beginning of the SSL handshake the name of the target server to connect to (usually the domain name).
+ `verify_mode` During the establishment of an SSL connection, the client usually needs to verify the validity of the server certificate to ensure that the server it is communicating with is trusted. Python's ssl module provides several different authentication mode options:
  + `ssl.CERT_NONE` Indicates that certificate verification is not performed. If you want to connect to a server that issues certificates using a self-signed certificate or a private CA, `verify_mode` must be `ssl.CERT_NONE`.
  + `ssl.CERT_REQUIRED` Mandatory server certificate verification.
  + `ssl.CERT_OPTIONAL` Certificate verification is optional and is optional by default.
+ `handsake_error_log` Used to control whether and how to record the error information during the handshake. The default value is `False`.
+ `passwd`  Certificate password. Optional.

#### client sslopt

``` python
sslopt = {
	'hostname': '127.0.0.1',
	'load_default_certs': False,
	'ca_cert': 'ca.crt',
	'verify_mode': ssl.CERT_REQUIRED,
	'handsake_error_log': True,
}
```

+ `hostname` The host name or IP address of the server to connect.
+ `load_default_certs` Whether to load the default system certificate. When set to `True`, Python's SSL module attempts to load some of the trusted certificates configured by the system default. if you are connecting to a server that issues certificates using a self-signed certificate or a private CA, you may need to configure additional certificate-related options (such as via ca_cert, etc.) to ensure that the authentication passes.
+ `ca_cert` Specifies the certificate file of the certificate Authority (CA) that is used to verify that the server certificate is valid.
+ `verify_mode` Same as server sslopt usage.
+ `handsake_error_log` Same as server sslopt usage.

### bidirectional authentication sslopt

#### server sslopt

``` python
sslopt = {
	'cert': 'server.crt',
	'key': 'server.key',
	'ca_cert': 'ca.crt',
	'load_default_certs': False,
	'sni_callback': sni_callback,
	'verify_mode': ssl.CERT_REQUIRED,
	'handsake_error_log': True,
	'passwd': None
}
```

`bidirectional authentication` has one more `ca_cert` than `one-way authentication`.

+ `ca_cert` When the sslopt dictionary contains the 'ca_cert' key, it means that two-way authentication is required, that is, the server must not only prove its identity to the client, but also verify the identity of the client.

#### client sslopt

``` python
sslopt = {
	'hostname': '127.0.0.1',
	'load_default_certs': True,
	'ca_cert': 'ca.crt',
	'cert': 'client.crt',
	'key': 'client.key',
	'verify_mode': ssl.CERT_REQUIRED,
	'handsake_error_log': True,
	'passwd': None
}
```

`bidirectional authentication` has more `cert` and `key` than `one-way authentication`.

+ `cert`  Client certificate file path.
+ `key` Client private key file path.
+ `passwd` Certificate password. Optional.

## server.onclient
+ On client connect / disconnect callback.

The server will call this function when the client connects and disconnects.

``` python
def onclient(cli, conn: bool):
	print('Client:', cli.id, 'connect:', conn)

server.onclient = onclient
```

## server.ondata
+ On client DATAGRAM data received callback.

The server will call this function when client DATAGRAM data received.

``` python
def ondata(cli, url: str, payload: vsoa.Payload, quick: bool):
	print('Client:' cli.id, 'DATARAM URL:', url, 'Payload:', dict(payload), 'Q:', quick)

server.ondata = ondata
```

## server.create_stream(onlink: callable, ondata: callable = None, timeout: float = 5.0) -> vsoa.Server.Stream
+ `onlink` Client stream connect / disconnect callback.
+ `ondata` Receive client stream data callback.
+ `timeout` Wait for client connection timeout, unit seconds, default is 5s.

Create a stream to communicate with the client via stream. During normal communication, `onlink` will be called twice, once when the connection is successful and once when the connection is disconnected. When the stream wait times out, `onlink` will only be called once, and the `conn` parameter is `False`.

Server:
``` python
@server.command('/get_data')
def get_data(cli, request, payload):
	def onlink(stream, conn: bool):
		if conn:
			with open('file') as file:
				stream.send(file.read())

	def ondata(stream, data: bytes):
		print('Received:', len(data))

	stream = server.create_stream(onlink, ondata)
	cli.reply(request.seqno, tunid = stream.tunid)
```

Client:
``` python
client = vsoa.Client()
client.robot(...)

file = None
def onlink(stream, conn: bool):
	if conn:
		file = open('file')
	else:
		if file:
			file.close()
			file = None

def ondata(stream, data: bytes):
	file.write(data)

header, payload, _ = client.fetch('/get_data')
if header and header.tunid > 0
	stream = client.create_stream(header.tunid, onlink, ondata)
```

# VSOA Server Remote Client Object
## cli.id

Client ID getter. (`int` type)

## cli.authed

Whether this client has logged in. When a client correctly connects to the server (passed the password check), this property defaults to `True`. If the server requires other login authentication methods at this time, you can set this property to `False`, and the client will not be able to receive publish message from current server.

``` python
def onclient(cli, conn: bool):
	if conn:
		cli.authed = False # This client can not received publish message

server.onclient = onclient

@server.command('/user_auth')
def user_auth(cli, request, payload):

+ `conn_timeout` Connection timeout, the minimum is **50ms.**
+ `reconn_delay` Waiting time for reconnection after disconnection.
+ `sslopt` TLS connection options, Optional. Default is `None`.

This function will automatically start a robot thread to handle the client event loop, and will automatically handle broken links.

``` python
client = vsoa.Client()
client.robot('vsoa://192.168.1.1:3005') # Automatically create a new thread responsible for the event loop

while True:
	time.sleep(1)

	header, payload, errcode = client.fetch('/echo', payload = { 'param': { 'a': 3 }})

# VSOA Client 'Once'
If we only need one RPC request and don't want to maintain a long-term connection with the server, we can use the following operation.

## vsoa.fetch(url: str, passwd: str = None, method: str | int = 0, payload: vsoa.Payload | dict = None, timeout: float = 10.0, raw: bool = False, sslopt: dict = None) -> tuple[vsoa.Header, vsoa.Payload, int]

``` python
header, payload, _ = vsoa.fetch('vsoa://192.168.1.1:3001/echo', payload = { 'param': { 'a': 3 }})
if header:
	print(dict(header), dict(payload))
```

# VSOA Position Server
## vsoa.Position(onquery: callable)
+ `onquery` Client host address query callback.

	if search['name'] == 'myserver':
		reply({ 'addr': '127.0.0.1', 'port': 3005, 'domain': socket.AF_INET })
	else:
		reply(None)

pserv = vsoa.Position(onquery)

pserv.run('0.0.0.0', 3000) # Position server run, never return
```

# VSOA Position Query
## vsoa.pos(addr: str, port: int)
+ `addr` Position server IP address.

``` python
addr, port = vsoa.lookup('myserv')
if addr:
	...
```

Query order:
+ Use the position server specified by `vsoa.pos()`
+ Use the position server specified by the `VSOA_POS_SERVER` environment variable.
+ Use the position server specified by the `/etc/vsoa.pos` configuration file (`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\vsoa.pos` on windows)

# VSOA Timer
VSOA provides a general timer function, and the timer callback will be executed in the timer service thread.

## vsoa.Timer() 

Create a timer object.

## timer.start(timeout: float, callback: callable, interval: float = 0, args = (), kwargs = {})
+ `timeout` Timer timeout seconds must be greater than 0.
+ `callback` Timer timeout callback.
+ `interval` Periodic interval seconds, `0` means one shot timing.
+ `args` Callback arguments.
+ `kwargs` Callback keywords arguments.

``` python
timer = vsoa.Timer()

def func(a, b, c):
	print('timer!', a, b, c)

# One shot timer, Execute `func` function after 1.5s
timer.start(1.5, func, args = (1, 2, 3))
```

## timer.stop()

Stop a timer. A stopped timer can be started again.

## timer.is_started() -> bool

Check whether the timer is timing.

# VSOA EventEmitter
vsoa provides an `EventEmitter` class similar to JSRE and NodeJS to facilitate event subscription.

`EventEmitter` has two special events `new_listener` and `remove_listener` indicating the installation and removal of listener. These events is generated automatically. Developers are not allowed to emit these events.

`new_listener`and `remove_listener` event callback parameters are as follows:

+ `event` Event.
+ `listener` Event listener.

## vsoa.EventEmitter()

Event emitter class, Users class can inherit this class, Create a event object.

``` python
class MyClass(vsoa.EventEmitter):
	def __init__(self):
		super().__init__()
		...
```

## event.add_listerner(event, listener: callable) 
+ `event` Event.
+ `listener` When this event occurs, this callback function is executed.

Add a listener for the specified event. The listener function arguments need to be consistent with the parameters generated by the event.

``` python
def func():
	print('event catched!')

event = vsoa.EventEmitter()

# Add listener
event.add_listerner('test', func)

# Emit event
event.emit('test')
```

## event.on(event, listener: callable) 

Alias ​​of `event.add_listerner`.

## event.once(event: int | str | object, listener: callable) -> None

Similar to `event.add_listerner`, but the added event listener function will only be executed once.

## event.remove_listener(event, listener: callable = None) -> bool
+ `event` Event.
+ `listener` Need matching listener function.

Delete the previously added event listener. If `listener` is `None`, it means deleting all listeners for the specified event.

## event.remove_all_listeners(event = None) 
+ `event` Event.

Delete all listeners for the specified event, `event` is `None` means deleting all listeners functions for all events.

## event.listener_count(event) -> int
+ `event` Event.

Get the number of listeners for the specified event.

## event.listeners(event) -> list[callable]
+ `event` Event.

Get the listener list of the specified event.

## event.emit(event, args = (), kwargs = {}) -> bool
+ `event` Event.
+ `args` Event arguments.
+ `kwargs` Event keyword arguments.

Generate an event, the listener corresponding to this event will be run according to the installation order.

``` python
class MyClass(vsoa.EventEmitter):
	def __init__(self):
		super().__init__()
		self.on('test', self.on_test)

	def on_test(self, a, b) -> None:
		print(a, b)

e = MyClass()
e.emit('test', args = (1, 2))
```

# VSOA WorkQueue
VSOA provides an asynchronous work queue function. Users can add job functions to the asynchronous work queue for sequential execution.

## vsoa.WorkQueue() 

Create a work queue.

## wq.add(func: callable, args = (), kwargs = {})
+ `func` Work queue job function.
+ `args` Function arguments.
+ `kwargs` Function keywords arguments.

``` python
def hello(count: int):
	print('Hello count:', count)

wq = vsoa.WorkQueue()
wq.add(hello, args = (1,))
wq.add(hello, args = (2,))
wq.add(hello, args = (3,))
```

The server can use `WorkQueue` to implement asynchronous command processing to avoid the main loop being blocked for too long.

``` python
app = vsoa.Server('hello')
wq  = vsoa.WorkQueue()

@app.command('/hello', wq)
def echo(cli, request, payload):
	cli.reply(request.seqno, payload)

app.run('0.0.0.0', 3005)
```

## wq.add_if_not_queued(func: callable, args = (), kwargs = {}) -> bool
+ `func` Work queue job function.
+ `args` Function arguments.
+ `kwargs` Function keywords arguments.
+ Returns: Whether add is successful.

Add job if job function not in queued.

## wq.delete(func: callable) -> bool
+ `func` Work queue job function.
+ Returns: Whether the deletion is successful.

Delete the specified job that is not being executed in the queue.

## wq.is_queued(func: callable) -> bool
+ `func` Work queue job function.
+ Returns: Whether queued.

Whether the specified job is in the queue.
