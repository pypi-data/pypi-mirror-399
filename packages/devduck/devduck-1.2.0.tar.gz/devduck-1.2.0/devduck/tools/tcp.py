"""TCP tool for DevDuck agents with real-time streaming support.

This module provides TCP server and client functionality for DevDuck agents,
allowing them to communicate over TCP/IP networks with real-time response streaming.
The tool runs server operations in background threads, enabling concurrent
communication without blocking the main agent.

Key Features:
1. TCP Server: Listen for incoming connections and process them with a DevDuck agent
2. Real-time Streaming: Responses stream to clients as they're generated (non-blocking)
3. TCP Client: Connect to remote TCP servers and exchange messages
4. Background Processing: Server runs in a background thread
5. Per-Connection DevDuck: Creates a fresh DevDuck instance for each client connection
6. Callback Handler: Uses Strands callback system for efficient streaming

How Streaming Works:
-------------------
Instead of blocking until the full response is ready, this implementation uses
Strands' callback_handler mechanism to stream data as it's generated:

- Text chunks stream immediately as the model generates them
- Tool invocations are announced in real-time
- Tool results are sent as they complete
- No buffering delays - everything is instant

Usage with DevDuck Agent:

```python
from devduck import devduck

# Start a streaming TCP server (each connection gets its own DevDuck instance)
result = devduck.agent.tool.tcp(
    action="start_server",
    host="127.0.0.1",
    port=8000,
    system_prompt="You are a helpful TCP server assistant.",
)

# Connect as a client and receive streaming responses
result = devduck.agent.tool.tcp(
    action="client_send",
    host="127.0.0.1",
    port=8000,
    message="What's 2+2?"
)

# Stop the TCP server
result = devduck.agent.tool.tcp(action="stop_server", port=8000)
```

For testing with netcat:
```bash
# Start server from devduck
devduck "start a tcp server on port 8000"

# Connect with netcat and chat in real-time
nc localhost 8000
```

See the tcp function docstring for more details on configuration options and parameters.

    """Create and manage TCP servers and clients with real-time streaming for DevDuck instances.

    This function provides TCP server and client functionality for DevDuck agents,
    allowing them to communicate over TCP/IP networks. Servers run in background
    threads with a new, fresh DevDuck instance for each client connection.

    **Real-time Streaming:** Unlike traditional blocking TCP responses, this
    implementation streams data as it's generated using Strands' callback_handler
    mechanism. Clients receive:
    - Text chunks as the model generates them (no buffering)
    - Tool invocation notifications in real-time
    - Tool completion status immediately
    - Reasoning text (if enabled)

    How It Works:
    ------------
    1. Server Mode:
       - Starts a TCP server in a background thread
       - Creates a dedicated DevDuck instance for EACH client connection
       - Attaches a streaming callback handler to send data immediately
       - Each DevDuck has full self-healing, hot-reload, and all tools
       - Processes client messages with non-blocking streaming responses

    2. Client Mode:
       - Connects to a TCP server
       - Sends messages and receives responses
       - Maintains stateless connections (no persistent sessions)

    3. Management:
       - Track server status and statistics
       - Stop servers gracefully
       - Monitor connections and performance

    Common Use Cases:
    ---------------
    - Network service automation with real-time feedback
    - Inter-agent communication with streaming
    - Remote command and control (instant responsiveness)
    - API gateway implementation with SSE-like behavior
    - IoT device management with live updates
    - Interactive chat services over raw TCP

    Args:
        action: Action to perform (start_server, stop_server, get_status, client_send)
        host: Host address for server or client connection
        port: Port number for server or client connection
        system_prompt: System prompt for the server DevDuck instances (for start_server)
        message: Message to send to the TCP server (for client_send action)
        timeout: Connection timeout in seconds (default: 90)
        buffer_size: Size of the message buffer in bytes (default: 4096)
        max_connections: Maximum number of concurrent connections (default: 5)

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing status and response content

    Notes:
        - Server instances persist until explicitly stopped
        - Each client connection gets its own DevDuck instance
        - Connection DevDuck instances have all standard DevDuck capabilities
        - Streaming is automatic via callback_handler (no configuration needed)
        - Client connections are stateless
        - Compatible with any TCP client (netcat, telnet, custom clients)

    Examples:
        # Start a streaming server
        devduck("start a tcp server on port 9000")

        # Test with netcat
        nc localhost 9000
