    Lazy strategy - create connections on demand.

    How it works:
        1. No setup during prepare()
        2. Each thread creates its own client when get_session() is called
        3. Connection established on first request

    Advantages:
        - Minimal setup time
        - Lower resource usage initially

    Disadvantages:
        - Poor timing for race conditions (> 100ms race window)
        - Each thread incurs TCP/TLS handshake overhead
        - NOT RECOMMENDED for race attacks

    Use cases:
        - Load testing (not race conditions)
        - Scenarios where connection timing doesn't matter
        - Testing connection establishment overhead

    Example:
        strategy = LazyStrategy()
        strategy.prepare(20, http_client)

        # In thread:
        client = strategy.get_session(thread_id)
        response = client.post(url, content=data)  # Connection happens HERE
