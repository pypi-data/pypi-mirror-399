    Pre-establish connections using httpx with HTTP/2 support.
    
    Each thread gets its own httpx.Client with a persistent connection.
    The connection is established during connect() phase, before the
    race synchronization point.
    
    Features:
        - HTTP/2 support (multiplexing, lower latency)
        - True persistent connections
        - Clean prepare/send separation
        - Proper TLS certificate verification control
        - Proxy support with bypass option
    
    Example:
        strategy = PreconnectStrategy(sync=BarrierSync())
        strategy.prepare(num_threads, http_client)
        
        # In each thread:
