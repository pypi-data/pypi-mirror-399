class MultiplexedStrategy(ConnectionStrategy):
    """
    Single HTTP/2 connection shared by all threads.
    
    HTTP/2 allows multiple concurrent streams over a single TCP connection.
    This strategy leverages that to achieve the tightest possible race window,
    as all requests go through the same socket.
    
    Benefits:
        - Single TCP/TLS handshake (faster setup)
        - All requests share the same connection
        - HTTP/2 multiplexing for true parallelism
        - Minimal race window (< 1ms typically)
    
    Limitations:
        - Requires HTTP/2 support on the server
        - Falls back to HTTP/1.1 if server doesn't support HTTP/2
        - Single connection = single point of failure
    
    Example:
        strategy = MultiplexedStrategy()
        strategy.prepare(num_threads, http_client)
        
        # In each thread:
        client = strategy.get_session(thread_id)  # Same client for all
        request = client.build_request("POST", "/api", content=body)
        # ... wait at barrier ...
        response = client.send(request)
