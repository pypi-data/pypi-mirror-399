**Production-grade AI agents defined in YAML, powered by LangGraph, deployed on Databricks.**

DAO is an **infrastructure-as-code framework** for building, deploying, and managing multi-agent AI systems. Instead of writing boilerplate Python code to wire up agents, tools, and orchestration, you define everything declaratively in YAML configuration files.

```yaml
# Define an agent in 10 lines of YAML
agents:
  product_expert:
    name: product_expert
    model: *claude_sonnet
    tools:
      - *vector_search_tool
      - *genie_tool
    prompt: |
      You are a product expert. Answer questions about inventory and pricing.
```

## Why DAO?

### For Newcomers to AI Agents

**What is an AI Agent?**
Think of an AI agent as an intelligent assistant that can actually *do things*, not just chat. Here's the difference:

- **Chatbot**: "The temperature in San Francisco is 65°F" (just talks)
- **AI Agent**: Checks weather APIs, searches your calendar, books a restaurant, and sends you a reminder (takes action)

An AI agent can:
- **Reason** about what steps are needed to accomplish a goal
- **Use tools** like databases, APIs, and search engines to gather information
- **Make decisions** about which actions to take next
- **Coordinate** with other specialized agents to handle complex requests

**Real-world example:** 
*"Find products that are low on stock and email the warehouse manager"*

- A chatbot would say: *"You should check inventory and contact the warehouse manager"*
- An AI agent would: Query the database, identify low-stock items, compose an email with the list, and send it

**What is Databricks?**
Databricks is a cloud platform where companies store and analyze their data. Think of it as a combination of:
- **Data warehouse** (where your business data lives)
- **AI/ML platform** (where you train and deploy models)
- **Governance layer** (controlling who can access what data)

Databricks provides several tools that DAO integrates with:
- **Unity Catalog**: Your organization's data catalog with security and permissions
- **Model Serving**: Turns AI models into APIs that applications can call
- **Vector Search**: Finds relevant information using semantic similarity (understanding meaning, not just keywords)
- **Genie**: Lets people ask questions in plain English and automatically generates SQL queries
- **MLflow**: Tracks experiments, versions models, and manages deployments

**Why DAO?**
DAO brings all these Databricks capabilities together into a unified framework for building AI agent systems. Instead of writing hundreds of lines of Python code to connect everything, you describe what you want in a YAML configuration file, and DAO handles the wiring for you.

**Think of it as:**
- **Traditional approach**: Building with LEGO bricks one by one (writing Python code)
- **DAO approach**: Using a blueprint that tells you exactly how to assemble the pieces (YAML configuration)

### When to Use DAO

✅ **Code-first workflow** — You prefer infrastructure-as-code with full Git integration, code reviews, and CI/CD pipelines  
✅ **Advanced caching** — You need LRU + semantic caching for Genie queries to optimize costs at scale  
✅ **Custom middleware** — You require assertion/validation logic, custom lifecycle hooks, or human-in-the-loop workflows  
✅ **Custom tools** — You're building proprietary Python tools or integrating with internal systems beyond standard integrations  
✅ **Swarm orchestration** — You need peer-to-peer agent handoffs (not just top-down supervisor routing)  
✅ **Stateful memory** — You require persistent conversation state in PostgreSQL, Lakebase, or custom backends  
✅ **Configuration reuse** — You want to maintain YAML templates, share them across teams, and version them in Git  
✅ **Regulated environments** — You need deterministic, auditable, and reproducible configurations for compliance  
✅ **Complex state management** — Your workflows require sophisticated state graphs with conditional branching and loops  

### When to Use Agent Bricks

✅ **Rapid prototyping** — You want to build and test an agent in minutes using guided wizards  
✅ **No-code/low-code** — You prefer GUI-based configuration over writing YAML or designing workflows  
✅ **Automated optimization** — You want the platform to automatically tune prompts, models, and benchmarks for you  
✅ **Business user access** — Non-technical stakeholders (analysts, product managers) need to build or modify agents  
✅ **Getting started** — You're new to AI agents and want pre-built templates (Information Extraction, Knowledge Assistant, Custom LLM)  
✅ **Standard use cases** — Your needs are met by UC Functions, MCP servers, Genie, and agent endpoints  
✅ **Multi-agent supervisor** — You need top-down orchestration with a supervisor routing to specialists  
✅ **Quality optimization** — You want automated benchmarking and continuous improvement based on feedback  

### When to Use Kasal

✅ **Visual workflow design** — You want to see and design agent interactions as a flowchart diagram  
✅ **Operational monitoring** — You need real-time visibility into agent execution with detailed logs and traces  
✅ **Role-based agents** — Your use case fits the CrewAI model of agents with specific roles, goals, and tasks  
✅ **Business process automation** — You're automating workflows where agents collaborate sequentially or hierarchically  
✅ **Data analysis pipelines** — You need agents to query, analyze, and visualize data with clear execution paths  
✅ **Content generation workflows** — Your agents collaborate on research, writing, and content creation tasks  
✅ **Team visibility** — Operations teams need to monitor and understand what agents are doing in real-time  
✅ **Quick deployment** — You want to deploy from Databricks Marketplace with minimal setup  
✅ **Drag-and-drop simplicity** — You prefer designing workflows visually rather than writing configuration files  

### Using All Three Together

Many teams use **multiple approaches** in their workflow, playing to each platform's strengths:

#### Progressive Sophistication Path

1. **Design in Kasal** → Visually prototype workflows and validate agent collaboration patterns
2. **Optimize in Agent Bricks** → Take validated use cases and let Agent Bricks auto-tune them
3. **Productionize in DAO** → For complex systems needing advanced features, rebuild in DAO with full control

#### Hybrid Architecture Patterns

**Pattern 1: Division by Audience**
- **Kasal**: Operations teams design and monitor customer support workflows
- **Agent Bricks**: Data analysts create optimized information extraction agents  
- **DAO**: ML engineers build the underlying orchestration layer with custom tools

**Pattern 2: Composition via Endpoints**
- **Agent Bricks**: Creates a Knowledge Assistant for HR policies (optimized automatically)
- **Kasal**: Designs a visual workflow for employee onboarding that calls the HR agent
- **DAO**: Orchestrates enterprise-wide employee support with custom payroll tools, approval workflows, and the agents from both platforms

**Pattern 3: Development Lifecycle**
- **Week 1**: Rapid prototype in Agent Bricks to validate business value
- **Week 2**: Redesign workflow visually in Kasal for team review and monitoring
- **Week 3**: Productionize in DAO with advanced caching, middleware, and CI/CD

```

#### Interoperability

All three platforms can call each other via **agent endpoints**:
- Deploy any agent to Databricks Model Serving
- Reference it as a tool using the `factory` tool type with `create_agent_endpoint_tool`
- Compose complex systems across platform boundaries

**Example:**
```yaml
# In DAO configuration
resources:
  llms:
    external_agent: &external_agent
      name: agent-bricks-hr-assistant  # Agent Bricks endpoint name

tools:
  hr_assistant:
    function:
      type: factory
      name: dao_ai.tools.create_agent_endpoint_tool
      args:
        llm: *external_agent
        name: hr_assistant
        description: "HR assistant built in Agent Bricks"
  
  workflow_monitor:
    function:
      type: factory
      name: dao_ai.tools.create_agent_endpoint_tool
      args:
        llm:
          name: kasal-workflow-monitor  # Kasal endpoint name
        name: workflow_monitor
        description: "Workflow monitor built in Kasal"
```

## Architecture

### How It Works (Simple Explanation)

Think of DAO as a three-layer cake:

**1. Your Configuration (Top Layer)** 🎂  
You write a YAML file describing what you want: which AI models, what data to access, what tools agents can use.

**2. DAO Framework (Middle Layer)** 🔧  
DAO reads your YAML and automatically wires everything together using LangGraph (a workflow engine for AI agents).

**3. Databricks Platform (Bottom Layer)** ☁️  
Your deployed agent runs on Databricks, accessing Unity Catalog data, calling AI models, and using other Databricks services.

### Orchestration Patterns

When you have multiple specialized agents, you need to decide how they work together. DAO supports two patterns:

**Think of it like a company:**
- **Supervisor Pattern** = Traditional hierarchy (manager assigns tasks to specialists)
- **Swarm Pattern** = Collaborative team (specialists hand off work to each other)

DAO supports both approaches for multi-agent coordination:

#### 1. Supervisor Pattern

**Best for:** Clear separation of responsibilities with centralized control

A central "supervisor" agent reads each user request and decides which specialist agent should handle it. Think of it like a call center manager routing calls to different departments.

**Example use case:** Hardware store assistant
- User asks about product availability → Routes to **Product Agent**
- User asks about order status → Routes to **Orders Agent**  
- User asks for DIY advice → Routes to **DIY Agent**

**Configuration:**

```yaml
orchestration:
  supervisor:
    model: *router_llm
    prompt: |
      Route queries to the appropriate specialist agent based on the content.
```

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │  Supervisor │
                    └──────┬──────┘
           ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
           ▼               ▼               ▼
    ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐
    │   Product   │ │   Orders    │ │     DIY     │
    │    Agent    │ │    Agent    │ │    Agent    │
    └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
```

#### 2. Swarm Pattern

**Best for:** Complex, multi-step workflows where agents need to collaborate

Agents work more autonomously and can directly hand off tasks to each other. Think of it like a team of specialists who know when to involve their colleagues.

**Example use case:** Complex customer inquiry
1. User: *"I need a drill for a home project, do we have any in stock, and can you suggest how to use it?"*
2. **Product Agent** checks inventory → Finds drill in stock → Hands off to **DIY Agent**
3. **DIY Agent** provides usage instructions → Done

No central supervisor needed — agents decide collaboratively.

**Configuration:**

```yaml
orchestration:
  swarm:
    model: *default_llm
    default_agent: *general_agent    # Where to start
    handoffs:
      product_agent: [orders_agent, diy_agent]  # Product agent can hand off to these
      orders_agent: [product_agent]             # Orders agent can hand off to Product
```

```
    ┌─────────────┐     handoff     ┌─────────────┐
    │   Product   │◄───────────────▶│   Orders    │
    │    Agent    │                 │    Agent    │
    └──────┬──────┘                 └──────┬──────┘
           │          handoff              │
           └──────────────┬────────────────┘
                          ▼
                   ┌─────────────┐
                   │     DIY     │
                   │    Agent    │
                   └─────────────┘
```

## Key Capabilities

These are the powerful features that make DAO production-ready. Don't worry if some seem complex — you can start simple and add these capabilities as you need them.

### 1. Multi-Tool Support

**What are tools?** Tools are actions an agent can perform — like querying a database, calling an API, or running custom code.

DAO supports four types of tools, each suited for different use cases:

| Tool Type | Use Case | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Python** | Custom business logic | `dao_ai.tools.current_time_tool` |
| **Factory** | Complex initialization with config | `create_vector_search_tool(retriever=...)`, `create_agent_endpoint_tool(llm=...)` |
| **Unity Catalog** | Governed SQL functions | `catalog.schema.find_product_by_sku` |
| **MCP** | External services via Model Context Protocol | GitHub, Slack, custom APIs |

```yaml
tools:
  # Python function - direct import
  time_tool:
    function:
      type: python
      name: dao_ai.tools.current_time_tool

  # Factory - initialized with config
  search_tool:
    function:
      type: factory
      name: dao_ai.tools.create_vector_search_tool
      args:
        retriever: *products_retriever

  # Unity Catalog - governed SQL function
  sku_lookup:
    function:
      type: unity_catalog
      name: find_product_by_sku
      schema: *retail_schema

  # MCP - external service integration
  github_mcp:
    function:
      type: mcp
      transport: streamable_http
      connection: *github_connection
```

### 2. On-Behalf-Of User Support

**What is this?** Many Databricks resources (like SQL warehouses, Genie spaces, and LLMs) can operate "on behalf of" the end user, using their permissions instead of the agent's service account credentials.

**Why this matters:**
- **Security**: Users can only access data they're authorized to see
- **Compliance**: Audit logs show the actual user who made the request, not a service account
- **Governance**: Unity Catalog permissions are enforced at the user level
- **Flexibility**: No need to grant broad permissions to a service account

**How it works:** When `on_behalf_of_user: true` is set, the resource inherits the calling user's identity and permissions from the API request.

**Supported resources:**
```yaml
resources:
  # LLMs - use caller's permissions for model access
  llms:
    claude: &claude
      name: databricks-claude-3-7-sonnet
      on_behalf_of_user: true      # Inherits caller's model access
  
  # Warehouses - execute SQL as the calling user
  warehouses:
    analytics: &analytics_warehouse
      warehouse_id: abc123def456
      on_behalf_of_user: true      # Queries run with user's data permissions
  
  # Genie - natural language queries with user's context
  genie_rooms:
    sales_genie: &sales_genie
      space_id: xyz789
      on_behalf_of_user: true      # Genie uses caller's data access
```

**Real-world example:**  
Your agent helps employees query HR data. With `on_behalf_of_user: true`:
- Managers can see their team's salary data
- Individual contributors can only see their own data
- HR admins can see all data

The same agent code enforces different permissions for each user automatically.

**Important notes:**
- The calling application must pass the user's identity in the API request
- The user must have the necessary permissions on the underlying resources
- Not all Databricks resources support on-behalf-of functionality

### 3. Advanced Caching (Genie Queries)

**Why caching matters:** When users ask similar questions repeatedly, you don't want to pay for the same AI processing over and over. Caching stores results so you can reuse them.

**What makes DAO's caching special:** Instead of just storing old answers (which become stale), DAO stores the **SQL query** that Genie generated. When a similar question comes in, DAO re-runs the SQL to get **fresh data** without calling the expensive Genie API again.

**💰 Cost savings:** If users frequently ask "What's our inventory?", the first query costs $X (Genie API call). Subsequent similar queries cost only pennies (just running SQL).

DAO provides **two-tier caching** for Genie natural language queries, dramatically reducing costs and latency:

```yaml
genie_tool:
  function:
    type: factory
    name: dao_ai.tools.create_genie_tool
    args:
      genie_room: *retail_genie_room
      
      # L1: Fast O(1) exact match lookup

```

#### LRU Cache (L1)

The **LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache** provides instant lookups for exact question matches:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `capacity` | 1000 | Maximum number of cached queries |
| `time_to_live_seconds` | 86400 | Cache entry lifetime (-1 = never expire) |
| `warehouse` | Required | Databricks warehouse for SQL execution |

**Best for:** Repeated exact queries, chatbot interactions, dashboard refreshes

#### Semantic Cache (L2)

The **Semantic Cache** uses PostgreSQL with pg_vector to find similar questions even when worded differently. It includes **conversation context awareness** to improve matching in multi-turn conversations:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `similarity_threshold` | 0.85 | Minimum similarity for cache hit (0.0-1.0) |
| `time_to_live_seconds` | 86400 | Cache entry lifetime (-1 = never expire) |
| `embedding_model` | `databricks-gte-large-en` | Model for generating question embeddings |
| `database` | Required | PostgreSQL with pg_vector extension |
| `warehouse` | Required | Databricks warehouse for SQL execution |
| `table_name` | `genie_semantic_cache` | Table name for cache storage |
| `context_window_size` | 3 | Number of previous conversation turns to include |
| `context_similarity_threshold` | 0.80 | Minimum similarity for conversation context |

**Best for:** Catching rephrased questions like:
- "What's our inventory status?" ≈ "Show me stock levels"
- "Top selling products this month" ≈ "Best sellers in December"

**Conversation Context Awareness:**  
The semantic cache tracks conversation history to resolve ambiguous references:
- **User:** "Show me products with low stock"
- **User:** "What about *them* in the warehouse?" ← Uses context to understand "them" = low stock products

This works by embedding both the current question *and* recent conversation turns, then computing a weighted similarity score. This dramatically improves cache hits in multi-turn conversations where users naturally use pronouns and references.

#### Cache Behavior

1. **SQL Caching, Not Results**: The cache stores the *generated SQL query*, not the query results. On a cache hit, the SQL is re-executed against your warehouse, ensuring **data freshness**.

2. **Conversation-Aware Matching**: The semantic cache uses a rolling window of recent conversation turns to provide context for similarity matching. This helps resolve pronouns and references like "them", "that", or "the same products" by considering what was discussed previously.

3. **Refresh on Hit**: When a semantic cache entry is found but expired:
   - The expired entry is deleted
   - A cache miss is returned
   - Genie generates fresh SQL
   - The new SQL is cached

4. **Multi-Instance Aware**: Each LRU cache is per-instance (in Model Serving, each replica has its own). The semantic cache is shared across all instances via PostgreSQL.

5. **Space ID Partitioning**: Cache entries are isolated per Genie space, preventing cross-space cache pollution.

### 4. Vector Search Reranking

**The problem:** Vector search (semantic similarity) is fast but sometimes returns loosely related results. It's like a librarian who quickly grabs 50 books that *might* be relevant.

**The solution:** Reranking is like having an expert review those 50 books and pick the best 5 that *actually* answer your question.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ More accurate search results
- ✅ Better user experience (relevant answers)
- ✅ No external API calls (runs locally with FlashRank)

DAO supports **two-stage retrieval** with FlashRank reranking to improve search relevance without external API calls:

```yaml
retrievers:
  products_retriever: &products_retriever
    vector_store: *products_vector_store
    columns: [product_id, name, description, price]
    search_parameters:
      num_results: 50        # Retrieve more candidates
      query_type: ANN
    rerank:
      model: ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2   # Local cross-encoder model
      top_n: 5                          # Return top 5 after reranking
```

#### Why Reranking?

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Vector Search Only** | Fast, scalable | Embedding similarity ≠ relevance |
| **Reranking** | More accurate relevance | Slightly higher latency |
| **Both (Two-Stage)** | Best of both worlds | Optimal quality/speed tradeoff |

Vector embeddings capture semantic similarity but may rank loosely related documents highly. Cross-encoder reranking evaluates query-document pairs directly, dramatically improving result quality for the final user.

#### Available Models

| Model | Speed | Quality | Use Case |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| `ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-2-v2` | ⚡⚡⚡ Fastest | Good | High-throughput, latency-sensitive |
| `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` | ⚡⚡ Fast | Better | Balanced performance |
| `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2` | ⚡ Moderate | Best | Default, recommended |
| `rank-T5-flan` | Slower | Excellent | Maximum accuracy |

#### Configuration Options

```yaml
rerank:
  model: ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2    # FlashRank model name
  top_n: 10                          # Documents to return (default: all)
  cache_dir: /tmp/flashrank_cache    # Model weights cache location
  columns: [description, name]       # Columns for Databricks Reranker (optional)
```

**Note:** Model weights are downloaded automatically on first use (~20MB for MiniLM-L-12-v2).

### 5. Human-in-the-Loop Approvals

**Why this matters:** Some actions are too important to automate completely. For example, you might want human approval before an agent:
- Deletes data
- Sends external communications
- Places large orders
- Modifies production systems

**How it works:** Add a simple configuration to any tool, and the agent will pause and ask for human approval before executing it.

Add approval gates to sensitive tool calls without changing tool code:

```yaml
tools:
  dangerous_operation:
    function:
      type: python
      name: my_package.dangerous_function
      human_in_the_loop:
        review_prompt: "This operation will modify production data. Approve?"
```

### 6. Memory & State Persistence

**What is memory?** Your agent needs to remember past conversations. When a user asks "What about size XL?" the agent should remember they were talking about shirts.

**Memory backend options:**
1. **In-Memory**: Fast but temporary (resets when agent restarts). Good for testing and development.
2. **PostgreSQL**: Persistent relational storage (survives restarts). Good for production systems requiring conversation history and user preferences.
3. **Lakebase**: Databricks-native persistence layer built on Delta Lake. Good for production deployments that want to stay within the Databricks ecosystem.

**Why Lakebase?**
- **Native Databricks integration** - No external database required
- **Built on Delta Lake** - ACID transactions, time travel, scalability
- **Unified governance** - Same Unity Catalog permissions as your data
- **Cost-effective** - Uses existing Databricks storage and compute

Configure conversation memory with in-memory, PostgreSQL, or Lakebase backends:

```yaml
memory:
  # Option 1: PostgreSQL (external database)
  checkpointer:
    name: conversation_checkpointer
    type: postgres
    database: *postgres_db
  
  store:
    name: user_preferences_store
    type: postgres
    database: *postgres_db
    embedding_model: *embedding_model

# Option 2: Lakebase (Databricks-native)
memory:
  checkpointer:
    name: conversation_checkpointer
    type: lakebase
    schema: *my_schema              # Unity Catalog schema
    table_name: agent_checkpoints   # Delta table for conversation state
  
  store:
    name: user_preferences_store
    type: lakebase
    schema: *my_schema
    table_name: agent_store         # Delta table for key-value storage
    embedding_model: *embedding_model
```

**Choosing a backend:**
- **In-Memory**: Development and testing only
- **PostgreSQL**: When you need external database features or already have PostgreSQL infrastructure
- **Lakebase**: When you want Databricks-native persistence with Unity Catalog governance

### 7. MLflow Prompt Registry Integration

**The problem:** Prompts (instructions you give to AI models) need constant refinement. Hardcoding them in YAML means every change requires redeployment.

**The solution:** Store prompts in MLflow's Prompt Registry. Now prompt engineers can:
- Update prompts without touching code
- Version prompts (v1, v2, v3...)
- A/B test different prompts
- Roll back to previous versions if needed

**Real-world example:**  
Your marketing team wants to make the agent's tone more friendly. With the prompt registry, they update it in MLflow, and the agent uses the new prompt immediately — no code deployment required.

Store and version prompts externally, enabling prompt engineers to iterate without code changes:

```yaml
prompts:
  product_expert_prompt:
    schema: *retail_schema
    name: product_expert_prompt
    alias: production  # or version: 3
    default_template: |
      You are a product expert...
    tags:
      team: retail
      environment: production

agents:
  product_expert:
    prompt: *product_expert_prompt  # Loaded from MLflow registry
```

### 8. Automated Prompt Optimization

**What is this?** Instead of manually tweaking prompts through trial and error, DAO can automatically test variations and find the best one.

**How it works:** Using GEPA (Generative Evolution of Prompts and Agents):
1. You provide a training dataset with example questions
2. DAO generates multiple prompt variations
3. Each variation is tested against your examples
4. The best-performing prompt is selected

**Think of it like:** A/B testing for AI prompts, but automated.

Use GEPA (Generative Evolution of Prompts and Agents) to automatically improve prompts:

```yaml
optimizations:
  prompt_optimizations:
    optimize_diy_prompt:
      prompt: *diy_prompt
      agent: *diy_agent
      dataset: *training_dataset
      reflection_model: "openai:/gpt-4"
      num_candidates: 5
```

### 9. Guardrails & Response Quality Middleware

**What are guardrails?** Safety and quality controls that validate agent responses before they reach users. Think of them as quality assurance checkpoints.

**Why this matters:** AI models can sometimes generate responses that are:
- Inappropriate or unsafe
- Too long or too short
- Missing required information (like citations)
- In the wrong format or tone
- Off-topic or irrelevant
- Containing sensitive keywords that should be blocked

DAO provides two complementary middleware systems for response quality control:

---

#### A. Guardrail Middleware (Content Safety & Quality)

**GuardrailMiddleware** uses LLM-as-judge to evaluate responses against custom criteria, with automatic retry and improvement loops.

**Use cases:**
- Professional tone validation
- Completeness checks (did the agent fully answer the question?)
- Accuracy verification
- Brand voice consistency
- Custom business rules

**How it works:**
1. Agent generates a response
2. LLM judge evaluates against your criteria (prompt-based)
3. If fails: Provides feedback and asks agent to try again
4. If passes: Response goes to user
5. After max retries: Falls back or raises error

```yaml
agents:
  customer_service_agent:
    model: *default_llm
    guardrails:
      # Professional tone check
      - name: professional_tone
        model: *judge_llm
        prompt: *professional_tone_prompt  # From MLflow Prompt Registry
        num_retries: 3
      
      # Completeness validation
      - name: completeness_check
        model: *judge_llm
        prompt: |
          Does the response fully address the user's question?
          Score 1 if yes, 0 if no. Explain your reasoning.
        num_retries: 2
```

**Additional guardrail types:**

```yaml
# Content Filter - Deterministic keyword blocking
guardrails:
  - name: sensitive_content_filter
    type: content_filter
    blocked_keywords:
      - password
      - credit_card
      - ssn
    case_sensitive: false
    on_failure: fallback
    fallback_message: "I cannot provide that information."

# Safety Guardrail - Model-based safety evaluation
guardrails:
  - name: safety_check
    type: safety
    model: *safety_model
    categories:
      - violence
      - hate_speech
      - self_harm
    threshold: 0.7           # Sensitivity threshold
    num_retries: 1
```

**Real-world example:**  
Your customer service agent must maintain a professional tone and never discuss competitor products:

```yaml
agents:
  support_agent:
    guardrails:
      - name: professional_tone
        model: *judge_llm
        prompt: *professional_tone_prompt
        num_retries: 3
      
      - name: no_competitors
        type: content_filter
        blocked_keywords: [competitor_a, competitor_b, competitor_c]
        on_failure: fallback
        fallback_message: "I can only discuss our own products and services."
```

---

#### B. DSPy-Style Assertion Middleware (Programmatic Validation)

**Assertion middleware** provides programmatic, code-based validation inspired by DSPy's assertion mechanisms. Best for deterministic checks and custom logic.

| Middleware | Behavior | Use Case |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **AssertMiddleware** | Hard constraint - retries until satisfied or fails | Required output formats, mandatory citations, length constraints |
| **SuggestMiddleware** | Soft constraint - logs feedback, optional single retry | Style preferences, quality suggestions, optional improvements |
| **RefineMiddleware** | Iterative improvement - generates N attempts, selects best | Optimizing response quality, A/B testing variations |

```yaml
# Configure via middleware in agents
agents:
  research_agent:
    middleware:
      # Hard constraint: Must include citations
      - type: assert
        constraint: has_citations
        max_retries: 3
        on_failure: fallback
        fallback_message: "Unable to provide cited response."
      
      # Soft suggestion: Prefer concise responses
      - type: suggest
        constraint: length_under_500
        allow_one_retry: true
```

**Programmatic usage:**

```python
from dao_ai.middleware.assertions import (
    create_assert_middleware,
    create_suggest_middleware,
    create_refine_middleware,
    LengthConstraint,
    KeywordConstraint,
)

# Hard constraint: response must be between 100-500 chars
assert_middleware = create_assert_middleware(
    constraint=LengthConstraint(min_length=100, max_length=500),
    max_retries=3,
    on_failure="fallback",
)

# Soft constraint: suggest professional tone
suggest_middleware = create_suggest_middleware(
    constraint=lambda response, ctx: "professional" in response.lower(),
    allow_one_retry=True,
)

# Iterative refinement: generate 3 attempts, pick best
def quality_score(response: str, ctx: dict) -> float:
    # Score based on length, keywords, structure
    score = 0.0
    if 100 <= len(response) <= 500:
        score += 0.5
    if "please" in response.lower() or "thank you" in response.lower():
        score += 0.3
    if response.endswith(".") or response.endswith("!"):
        score += 0.2
    return score

refine_middleware = create_refine_middleware(
    reward_fn=quality_score,
    threshold=0.8,
    max_iterations=3,
)
```

| **Quality optimization** | RefineMiddleware (generates multiple attempts) |
| **Soft suggestions** | SuggestMiddleware |

**Best practice:** Combine both approaches:
- **ContentFilter** for fast, deterministic blocking
- **AssertMiddleware** for programmatic constraints
- **GuardrailMiddleware** for nuanced, LLM-based evaluation

```yaml
agents:
  production_agent:
    middleware:
      # Layer 1: Fast keyword blocking
      - type: content_filter
        blocked_keywords: [password, ssn]
      
      # Layer 2: Deterministic length check
      - type: assert
        constraint: length_range
        min_length: 50
        max_length: 1000
      
      # Layer 3: LLM-based quality evaluation
      - type: guardrail
        name: professional_tone
        model: *judge_llm
        prompt: *professional_tone_prompt
```

### 10. Conversation Summarization

**The problem:** AI models have a maximum amount of text they can process (the "context window"). Long conversations eventually exceed this limit.

**The solution:** When conversations get too long, DAO automatically:
1. Summarizes the older parts of the conversation
2. Keeps recent messages as-is (for accuracy)
3. Continues the conversation with the condensed history

**Example:**  
After 20 messages about product recommendations, the agent summarizes: *"User is looking for power tools, prefers cordless, budget around $200."* This summary replaces the old messages, freeing up space for the conversation to continue.

Automatically summarize long conversation histories to stay within context limits:

```yaml
chat_history:
  max_tokens: 4096                    # Max tokens for summarized history
  max_tokens_before_summary: 8000     # Trigger summarization at this threshold
  max_messages_before_summary: 20     # Or trigger at this message count
```

The `LoggingSummarizationMiddleware` provides detailed observability:

```
INFO | Summarization: BEFORE 25 messages (~12500 tokens) → AFTER 3 messages (~2100 tokens) | Reduced by ~10400 tokens
```

### 11. Structured Output (Response Format)

**What is this?** A way to force your agent to return data in a specific JSON structure, making responses machine-readable and predictable.

**Why it matters:** 
- **Data extraction**: Extract structured information (product details, contact info) from text
- **API integration**: Return data that other systems can consume directly
- **Form filling**: Populate forms or databases automatically
- **Consistent parsing**: No need to write brittle text parsing code

**How it works:** Define a schema (Pydantic model, dataclass, or JSON schema) and the agent will return data matching that structure.

```yaml
agents:
  contact_extractor:
    name: contact_extractor
    model: *default_llm
    prompt: |
      Extract contact information from the user's message.
    response_format:
      response_schema: |
        {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "name": {"type": "string"},
            "email": {"type": "string"},
            "phone": {"type": ["string", "null"]}
          },
          "required": ["name", "email"]
        }
      use_tool: true  # Use function calling strategy (recommended for Databricks)
```

**Real-world example:**  
User: *"John Doe, john.doe@example.com, (555) 123-4567"*  
Agent returns:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phone": "(555) 123-4567"
}
```

**Options:**
- `response_schema`: Can be a JSON schema string, Pydantic model type, or fully qualified class name
- `use_tool`: `true` (function calling), `false` (native), or `null` (auto-detect)

See `config/examples/structured_output.yaml` for a complete example.

### 12. Custom Input & Custom Output Support

**What is this?** A flexible system for passing custom configuration values to your agents and receiving enriched output with runtime state.

**Why it matters:**
- **Pass context to prompts**: Any key in `configurable` becomes available as a template variable in your prompts
- **Personalize responses**: Use `user_id`, `store_num`, or any custom field to tailor agent behavior
- **Track conversations**: Maintain state across multiple interactions with `thread_id`/`conversation_id`
- **Capture runtime state**: Output includes accumulated state like Genie conversation IDs, cache hits, and more
- **Debug production issues**: Full context visibility for troubleshooting

**Key concepts:**
- `configurable`: Custom key-value pairs passed to your agent (available in prompt templates)
- `thread_id` / `conversation_id`: Identifies a specific conversation thread
- `user_id`: Identifies who's asking questions
- `session`: Runtime state that accumulates during the conversation (returned in output)

DAO uses a structured format for passing custom inputs and returning enriched outputs:

```python
# Input format
custom_inputs = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "uuid-123",        # LangGraph thread ID
        "conversation_id": "uuid-123",  # Databricks-style (takes precedence)
        "user_id": "user@example.com",
        "store_num": "12345",
    },
    "session": {
        # Accumulated runtime state (optional in input)
    }
}

# Output format includes session state
custom_outputs = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "uuid-123",
        "conversation_id": "uuid-123",
        "user_id": "user@example.com",
    },
    "session": {
        "genie": {
            "spaces": {
                "space_abc": {
                    "conversation_id": "genie-conv-456",
                    "cache_hit": True,
                    "follow_up_questions": ["What about pricing?"]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Using configurable values in prompts:**

Any key in the `configurable` dictionary becomes available as a template variable in your agent prompts:

```yaml
agents:
  personalized_agent:
    prompt: |
      You are a helpful assistant for {user_id}.
      Store location: {store_num}
      
      Provide personalized recommendations based on the user's context.
```

When invoked with the `custom_inputs` above, the prompt automatically populates:
- `{user_id}` → `"user@example.com"`
- `{store_num}` → `"12345"`

**Key features:**
- `conversation_id` and `thread_id` are interchangeable (conversation_id takes precedence)
- If neither is provided, a UUID is auto-generated
- `user_id` is normalized (dots replaced with underscores for memory namespaces)
- All `configurable` keys are available as prompt template variables
- `session` state is automatically maintained and returned in `custom_outputs`
- Backward compatible with legacy flat custom_inputs format

### 13. Hook System

**What are hooks?** Hooks let you run custom code at specific moments in your agent's lifecycle — like "before starting" or "when shutting down".

**Common use cases:**
- Warm up caches on startup
- Initialize database connections
- Clean up resources on shutdown
- Load configuration or credentials

**For per-message logic** (logging requests, checking permissions, etc.), use **middleware** instead. Middleware provides much more flexibility and control over the agent execution flow.

Inject custom logic at key points in the agent lifecycle:

```yaml
app:
  # Run on startup
  initialization_hooks:
    - my_package.hooks.setup_connections
    - my_package.hooks.warmup_caches

  # Run on shutdown
  shutdown_hooks:
    - my_package.hooks.cleanup_resources

agents:
  my_agent:
    # For per-agent logic, use middleware
    middleware:
      - my_package.middleware.log_requests
      - my_package.middleware.check_permissions
```

## Quick Start

### Choose Your Path

**Path 1: Visual Interface** → Use [DAO AI Builder](https://github.com/natefleming/dao-ai-builder) for a graphical, point-and-click experience

**Path 2: Code/Config** → Follow the instructions below to work with YAML files directly

Both paths produce the same result — choose what's comfortable for you!

---

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- **Python 3.11 or newer** installed on your computer ([download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **A Databricks workspace** (ask your IT team or see [Databricks docs](https://docs.databricks.com/))
  - Access to **Unity Catalog** (your organization's data catalog)
  - **Model Serving** enabled (for deploying AI agents)
  - *Optional*: Vector Search, Genie (for advanced features)

**Not sure if you have access?** Your Databricks administrator can grant you permissions.

### Installation

**Option 1: For developers familiar with Git**

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd dao-ai

# Create an isolated Python environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install DAO and its dependencies
make install
```

**Option 2: For those new to development**

1. Download this project as a ZIP file (click the green "Code" button on GitHub → Download ZIP)
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to that folder
4. Run these commands:

```bash
# On Mac/Linux:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# On Windows:
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

**Verification:** Run `dao-ai --version` to confirm the installation succeeded.

### Your First Agent

Let's build a simple AI assistant in 4 steps. This agent will use a language model from Databricks to answer questions.

**Step 1: Create a configuration file**

Create a new file called `config/my_agent.yaml` and paste this content:

```yaml
schemas:
  my_schema: &my_schema
    catalog_name: my_catalog        # Replace with your Unity Catalog name
    schema_name: my_schema          # Replace with your schema name

resources:
  llms:
    default_llm: &default_llm
      name: databricks-meta-llama-3-3-70b-instruct  # The AI model to use

agents:
  assistant: &assistant
    name: assistant
    model: *default_llm
    prompt: |
      You are a helpful assistant.

app:
  name: my_first_agent
  registered_model:
    schema: *my_schema
    name: my_first_agent
  agents:
    - *assistant
  orchestration:
    swarm:
      model: *default_llm
```

**💡 What's happening here?**
- `schemas`: Points to your Unity Catalog location (where the agent will be registered)
- `resources`: Defines the AI model (Llama 3.3 70B in this case)
- `agents`: Describes your assistant agent and its behavior
- `app`: Configures how the agent is deployed and orchestrated

**Step 2: Validate your configuration**

This checks for errors in your YAML file:

```bash
dao-ai validate -c config/my_agent.yaml
```

You should see: ✅ `Configuration is valid!`

**Step 3: Visualize the agent workflow** (optional)

Generate a diagram showing how your agent works:

```bash
dao-ai graph -c config/my_agent.yaml -o my_agent.png
```

This creates `my_agent.png` — open it to see a visual representation of your agent.

**Step 4: Deploy to Databricks**

**Option A: Using Python** (programmatic deployment)

```python
from dao_ai.config import AppConfig

# Load your configuration
config = AppConfig.from_file("config/my_agent.yaml")

# Package the agent as an MLflow model
config.create_agent()

# Deploy to Databricks Model Serving
config.deploy_agent()
```

**Option B: Using the CLI** (one command)

```bash
dao-ai bundle --deploy --run -c config/my_agent.yaml
```

This single command:
1. Validates your configuration
2. Packages the agent
3. Deploys it to Databricks
4. Creates a serving endpoint

**Step 5: Interact with your agent**

Once deployed, you can chat with your agent using Python:

```python
from mlflow.deployments import get_deploy_client

# Connect to your Databricks workspace
client = get_deploy_client("databricks")

# Send a message to your agent
response = client.predict(
    endpoint="my_first_agent",
    inputs={
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello! What can you help me with?"}],
        "configurable": {
            "thread_id": "1",           # Conversation ID
            "user_id": "demo_user"      # User identifier
        }
    }
)

# Print the agent's response
print(response["message"]["content"])
```

**🎉 Congratulations!** You've built and deployed your first AI agent with DAO.

**Next steps:**
- Explore the [`config/examples/`](config/examples/) folder for more advanced configurations
- Try the [DAO AI Builder](https://github.com/natefleming/dao-ai-builder) visual interface
- Add tools to your agent (database access, APIs, Vector Search)
- Set up multi-agent orchestration (Supervisor or Swarm patterns)

## Common Questions

### How is this different from LangChain/LangGraph directly?

DAO is **built on top of** LangChain and LangGraph. Instead of writing Python code to configure agents, you use YAML files. Think of it as:
- **LangChain/LangGraph**: The engine
- **DAO**: The blueprint system that configures the engine

Benefits:
- ✅ No Python coding required (just YAML)
- ✅ Configurations are easier to review and version control
- ✅ Databricks-specific integrations work out-of-the-box
- ✅ Reusable patterns across your organization

### Do I need to learn Python?

**For basic usage:** No. You only need to write YAML configuration files.

**For advanced usage:** Some Python knowledge helps if you want to:
- Create custom tools
- Write middleware hooks
- Build complex business logic

Most users stick to YAML and use pre-built tools.

### Can I test locally before deploying?

Yes! DAO includes a local testing mode:

```python
from dao_ai.config import AppConfig

config = AppConfig.from_file("config/my_agent.yaml")
agent = config.as_runnable()

# Test locally
response = agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Test question"}]
})
print(response)
```

### What's the learning curve?

**If you're new to AI agents:** 1-2 weeks to understand concepts and build your first agent

**If you know LangChain:** 1-2 days to translate your knowledge to YAML configs

**If you're a business user:** Consider starting with [DAO AI Builder](https://github.com/natefleming/dao-ai-builder) (visual interface)

### How do I get help?

1. Check the [`config/examples/`](config/examples/) directory for working examples
2. Review this README for detailed explanations
3. Read the [Configuration Reference](#configuration-reference) section
4. Open an issue on GitHub
