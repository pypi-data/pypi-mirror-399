"""
Utilities methods that may be used for database querying purpose.

Because UUIDv7 are timestamped ordered and monotonically increasing,
there are a good solution for generating primary keys.

The design of UUIDv7 feet well with the design of BTree.

Because they contains a date time, a UUID range can be compute
in order to retrieve UUIDs generated at a given time.
