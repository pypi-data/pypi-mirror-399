# cici pipeline

Build and publish CI/CD pipeline components with cici.

cici, short for Continuous Integration Catalog Interface, is a framework and
toolkit for managing the integration and lifecycle of packaged CI/CD
components in a software delivery pipeline.

cici enables the efficient sharing of CI/CD code in an organization, and
eliminates a major source of friction that otherwise leads to poor adoption of
automation and DevOps practices.

cici is a foundational component of [saferatday0](https://saferatday0.dev/)
and powers the [saferatday0 library](https://gitlab.com/saferatday0/library).
