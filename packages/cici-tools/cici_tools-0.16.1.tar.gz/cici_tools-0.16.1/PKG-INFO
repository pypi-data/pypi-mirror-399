<!-- END BADGIE TIME -->

**cici**, short for **Continuous Integration Catalog
Interface**, is a framework and toolkit for managing the integration and
lifecycle of packaged CI/CD components in a software delivery pipeline.

cici enables the efficient sharing of CI/CD code in an organization, and
eliminates a major source of friction that otherwise leads to poor adoption of
automation and DevOps practices.

cici is a foundational component of [saferatday0](https://saferatday0.dev) and
powers the [saferatday0 library](https://gitlab.com/saferatday0/library).

## Installation

```sh
pip install cici-tools
```

## Usage

### `cici bundle`

Flatten `extends` keywords to make zero-dependency GitLab CI/CD files.

```bash
cici bundle
```

```console
$ cici bundle
⚡ python-autoflake.yml
⚡ python-black.yml
⚡ python-build-sdist.yml
⚡ python-build-wheel.yml
⚡ python-import-linter.yml
⚡ python-isort.yml
⚡ python-mypy.yml
⚡ python-pyroma.yml
⚡ python-pytest.yml
⚡ python-setuptools-bdist-wheel.yml
⚡ python-setuptools-sdist.yml
⚡ python-twine-upload.yml
⚡ python-vulture.yml
```

### `cici readme`

Generate a README for your pipeline project:

```bash
cici readme
```

To customize the output, copy the default README template to `README.md.j2` in
your project root and modify:

```j2
# {{ name }} pipeline

{%- include "brief.md.j2" %}
{%- include "description.md.j2" %}

{%- include "groups.md.j2" %}

{%- include "targets.md.j2" %}

{%- include "variables.md.j2" %}
```

### `cici update`

Update to the latest GitLab CI/CD `include` versions available.

```bash
cici update
```

```console
$ cici update
updated saferatday0/library/python to 0.5.1
updated saferatday0/library/gitlab from 0.1.0 to 0.2.2
```
