# Basehook

A webhook management system that groups updates by thread ID and lets you consume them either one-by-one or buffered (latest revision only).

## Core Concepts

**Thread-based grouping**: Webhooks are grouped by thread ID. Configure JSON paths to extract thread IDs and revision numbers from any format (Slack, GitHub, Shopify, etc.).

**Two consumption modes**:
- `pop(only_last_revision=False)` - Process updates one by one in order
- `pop(only_last_revision=True)` - Buffer updates and only consume the latest revision, skipping outdated ones

**Pull-based processing**: Your application pulls updates via `pop()` instead of receiving direct webhook POSTs. Failed processing is marked as ERROR and visible in the UI for manual retry.

## Quick Deploy

### Docker Compose (Self-hosting)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehdigmira/basehook.git
cd basehook
docker-compose up -d
```

Access at `http://localhost:8000`

## Usage

### 1. Configure webhook
Visit the UI and create a webhook with thread ID and revision number paths.

### 2. Install client library
```bash
pip install basehook
```

### 3. Consume updates
```python
from basehook import Basehook

basehook = Basehook(database_url="postgresql+asyncpg://...")

# Process updates one by one (in order)
async with basehook.pop("webhook-name", only_last_revision=False) as update:
    if update:
        process(update)

# Or buffer updates and only process latest revision
async with basehook.pop("webhook-name", only_last_revision=True) as update:
    if update:
        process(update)  # Older revisions automatically skipped
```
