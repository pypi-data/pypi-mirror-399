📘 **[Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md)** · 📝 **[Release Notes](https://github.com/apathetic-tools/python-logs/releases)**

**Small quality-of-life features on top of stdlib.**
*Because you don't need another large dependency.*

*Apathetic Python Logger* provides a lightweight, dependency-free logging solution designed for CLI tools. It extends Python's standard library `logging` module with colorized output, dual-stream handling (stdout/stderr), extra logging levels and context.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is largely AI-written and minimally polished. I rely on it, but I haven't reviewed every detail.
> Expect rough edges. Thoughtful issue reports are appreciated.

## Quick Start

from apathetic_logging import get_logger, register_logger

# Register your logger

# Get the logger instance
logger = get_logger()

# Use it!
logger.info("Hello, world!")
logger.detail("Extra verbosity above INFO")
logger.brief("Lower verbosity than INFO")
logger.trace("Trace information")
```
