            pointcloud (numpy.ndarray): Point cloud data. Each row
                represents a single point.
                Only 2D or 3D pointclouds are available.
            weight (bool): If False, the pointcloud has no weight. If True,
                the last column of the pointcloud ndarray is regarded as
                weights. Please note that the weight paramters of points
                should be the square of their own radii.
            squared (bool): By default, all birth/death times are squared.
                If squared is False, all computed birth/death times are
                not squared.
            no_squared (bool): See `squared` parameter.
            subsets (list[int] or bool or None):
                This parameter is currently unused.
            check_acyclicity (bool):
                This parameter is currently unused.
            algorithm (string or None): The name of the algorithm.
                An appropriate algorithm is
                automatically selected if None is given.

                The following algorithms are available:

                * "phat-twist"
                * "phat-chunk-parallel"

                In many cases, the parameter should be `None`.
            vertex_symbols (list[string] or None): The names of vertices.
                The names are used to represent some simplices, such as
                birth/death simplices or optimal volumes.

                If None is given, vertices are automatically named by
                "0", "1", "2", ...
            parallels (int): The number of threads used for the computation.
                This parameter is currently ignored.
                This parameter exists for backward compatibility.
            save_to (string): The file path which the computation result is
                saved into. You can load the saved data by
                ``homcloud.interface.PDList(FILE_PATH)``.
                Saving the result is recommended since the computation cost is
                often expensive.
            save_suppl_info (bool): Various supplimentary information is saved to
                the file `save_to`. The default is True. This information is
                required to show birth and death pixels and optimal volumes.
                If you do not use such HomCloud's functionality and you want to
                reduce the size of the file, please set the argument ``False``.
                If False, only birth and death times are stored to the file.
            save_boundary_map (bool):
                The boundary map constructed by the given pointcloud is saved
                if this parameter is True. The boundary map is used to
                compute volume optimal cycles.
            periodicity (tuple[tuple[float, float], tuple[float, float]], tuple[tuple[float, float], tuple[float, float], tuple[float, float]] or None):  # noqa E501
                Periodic boundary condition. Peridic boundary condition is not available for 2D alpha shape.
            save_phtrees (bool): The PH-trees for (n-1)st PH is saved if True.
                Use meth:`PD.load_phtrees` to load the PH trees.
        Returns:
            The :class:`PDList` object computed from the pointcloud.

        Warn:
            The pointcloud should be general position;
            that is, all combinations of three points should not be on a signle line,
            all combinations of four points should not be on a signle plane for 3D,
            all combinations of four points should not be on a single circle,
            and all combinations of five points should not be on a single sphere for 3D.
            If the input data does not satisfy general position condition,
            the alpha filtration cannot be computed correctly.
            If you want to use peridic boundary condition, the pointcloud has sufficiently many points.
            If the number of points is small, alpha shape cannot be computed correctly.

            periodicity (None, list of bool):

        You can calculate similar infomormation using :meth:`optimal_volume`, but optimal_volume
        optimal_volume may be expensive, especiall for Vietoris-Rips filtration.
        optimal_1_cycle can be computed at a lower cost than optimal_volume.
        In general, an optimal volume gives better information about the birth-death pair, and
        an optimal 1-cycle gives an approximation of the optimal volume.

        The algorithm in optimal_1_cycle computes the minimal loop that includes a birth edge
        (alpha, rips, abstract) or birth pixel (bitmap).

        This method is available only when degree == 1.

        If you want to compute optimal 1-cycle. You need to pass the following argument when computing
        persistence diagrams.

        * Vietoris-Rips filtration by :meth:`PDList.from_rips_filtration`: `save_graph=True`.
          In this case, this method returns an object of :class:`GraphOptimal1Cycle`.
        * Alpha filtration by :meth:`PDList.from_alpha_filtration`: `save_boundary_map=True`
          In this case, this method returns an object of :class:`Optimal1Cycle`.
        * Abstract filtration by :meth:`PDList.from_boundary_information`: `save_boundary_map=True`.
          In this case, this method returns an object of :class:`Optimal1Cycle`.
        * Bitmap filtration by :meth:`PDList.from_bitmap_levelset`: `save_suppl_info=True`
          In this case, this method returns an object of :class:`BitmapOptimal1Cycle`.
