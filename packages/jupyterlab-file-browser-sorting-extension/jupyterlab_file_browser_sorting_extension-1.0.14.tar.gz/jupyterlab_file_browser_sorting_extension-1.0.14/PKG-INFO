JupyterLab extension that implements LC_COLLATE=C (ASCIIbetical) sorting for the file browser.

## Features

- **LC_COLLATE=C sorting** - Standard Unix sorting order used by `ls` with C locale
- **Dot files first** - Hidden files (starting with `.`) appear before other files
- **Uppercase before lowercase** - Capital letters (A-Z) sort before lowercase (a-z)
- **ASCII order** - Characters sorted by their ASCII code values
- **Toggle via context menu** - Right-click in the file browser to enable/disable

## Usage

Right-click anywhere in the file browser content area and select **"Use Unix-Style Sorting (LC_COLLATE=C)"** to toggle the sorting mode. The setting is persisted across sessions.

When enabled, the extension sorts files using the standard Unix C locale collation sequence:

```
. (dot) -> 0-9 -> A-Z -> _ (underscore) -> a-z
```

**Example sort order:**

```
.hidden
.profile
123file
ABC
Makefile
README
_config
abc
readme
zebra
```

This matches the behavior of `LC_COLLATE=C ls` on Unix systems.

## Requirements

- JupyterLab >= 4.0.0

## Installation

```bash
pip install jupyterlab_file_browser_sorting_extension
```

## Uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall jupyterlab_file_browser_sorting_extension
```
