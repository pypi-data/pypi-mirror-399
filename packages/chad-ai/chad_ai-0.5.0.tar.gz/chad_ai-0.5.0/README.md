# Chad: YOLO AI

Coding agents need hand holding to implement complex features, but no one holds Chad's hand. 

Add one or more Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, or Mistral Vibe coding agent sessions, ask for a coding task, and Chad will 
verify and reprompt to deliver a one-shot result.

**The First Warning:** Chad was developed with...  Chad. Yes, this material writes itself. No, high quality robust code 
this is not. 

**World Warning II:** Chad is a risk-taker who knows no limits. Chad has access to everything on your hard drive and 
your internet connection. Responsible models will stop Chad if they have the right context to do so, and I added a 
safety prompt which will try to give them that context. However, if Chad REALLY wants to complete your task there
are only so many ways I can explicitly prohibit it from ruining your life.

### Blah blah how do I run it?
```bash
pip install chad-ai
chad 
```

### How is this better than $Grug?

-> Gradio UI to manage multiple coding agents, select preferred models, monitor usage quotas, and run tasks:
<details open>
<summary><b>Screenshots</b></summary>

#### Select a task and agent

#### Monitor multiple provider accounts with usage tracking

#### View completed tasks with verification results and live activity

</details>

-> Provider tokens encrypted with a master password you create each session

### Is this satire?

Sadly, no. "As a society, what are we even doing here?" might be a better question.
