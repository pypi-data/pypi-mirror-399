### Introduction

#### Bright, comprehensive, and built for discovery — the **Discover MIDI Dataset** is a massive, carefully curated collection of symbolic music designed for music information retrieval (MIR), creative exploration, and training symbolic music AI. It contains **over 6.74M unique, de‑duplicated, and normalized MIDI files**, comprehensive metadata, and GPU‑accelerated search tooling so researchers and creators can find, analyze, and prototype with MIDI at production scale.

### Abstract

_The **Discover MIDI Dataset** is a large‑scale, production‑ready collection of symbolic music designed for music information retrieval, discovery, and symbolic music AI. It aggregates **over 6.74 million** unique, de‑duplicated, and normalized MIDI files, each validated against the MIDI specification and integrity‑checked to ensure consistent, high‑quality inputs for analysis and model development. The dataset emphasizes reproducibility and efficiency by applying a two‑stage de‑duplication pipeline (MD5 hashing and pitch/chord count comparison) and by providing extensive, precomputed metadata and feature representations for every file._

_The dataset supplies **rich, structured metadata** including feature counts, compressed features matrixes (961 features excluding velocities), file lists, genre labels, artist/title identifications, karaoke and lyrics matches, monophonic melody summaries, pitches‑patches counts, and detailed quality metrics for alignment, chords, durations, and pitches. Features span a unified index range covering delta start times, durations, instruments/patches, instrument and drum pitches, a 321‑chord harmonic vocabulary, and velocities, enabling consistent statistical analysis, de‑duplication, and retrieval tasks across millions of files._

_To accelerate discovery workflows, Discover MIDI includes a **GPU‑accelerated search and filter engine** optimized for float16 performance; on suitable hardware (recommended ≥16 GB GPU VRAM) full‑dataset similarity searches complete in the order of **10–20 seconds per master MIDI**. The distribution also bundles supplemental code—such as a MIDI loops extractor—and curated soundfont banks to support rendering, loop extraction, and downstream experimentation. Convenience artifacts like MD5→path file lists and curated subsets make large‑scale batch processing and targeted retrieval straightforward._

_The dataset is packaged with clear installation and optional dependency instructions for CPU and GPU environments, plus modules to speed parallel extraction and audio rendering. Its combination of scale, rigorous de‑duplication, precomputed features, and high‑performance tooling makes Discover MIDI suitable for a wide range of use cases: training and evaluating symbolic music models, large‑scale MIR research, motif and loop discovery for creators, and building retrieval or recommendation systems with minimal preprocessing overhead._

### Overview

- **Purpose:** Large‑scale symbolic dataset for MIR, retrieval, analysis, and generative model development.  
- **Scale:** 6.74M+ unique MIDIs, each converted to a proper MIDI specification and integrity‑checked.  
- **Quality controls:** Two‑stage de‑duplication (MD5 and pitch/chord counts) and extensive quality metrics.  
- **Tooling:** Precomputed features, compressed features matrixes, and a custom GPU‑accelerated search and filter codebase.

### Key features

- **Massive, de‑duplicated collection** — over **6.74M** normalized MIDIs with integrity checks.  
- **Two‑stage de‑duping** — MD5 hash deduplication followed by pitch/chord counts deduplication.  
- **Rich metadata** — features counts, features matrixes, file lists, genre mappings, identified artist/title, karaoke and lyrics matches, mono‑melody info, pitches‑patches counts, and quality metrics.  
- **Precomputed features** — features span indices \([0,1089)\) grouped into delta start times, durations, instruments/patches, pitches, harmonic chords (321 chords), and velocities; matrixes exclude velocities and are stored as compressed NumPy arrays (961 features).  
- **High‑performance search** — GPU‑accelerated search and filter code optimized for float16; full searches typically take **10–20 seconds per master MIDI** on a capable GPU (recommended **≥16 GB VRAM**).  
- **Convenience files** — curated file lists (md5 → full path) and many subsets for easy retrieval and batch processing.  
- **Supplemental code** — MIDI loops extractor, rendering helpers, and optional modules to speed extraction and audio rendering.

## Quick-start use example

```python
# Import main Discover MIDI Dataset module
import discovermidi

# Download Discover MIDI Dataset from Hugging Face repo
discovermidi.download_dataset()

# Extract Discover MIDI Dataset with built-in function (slow)
discovermidi.parallel_extract()

# Or you can extract much faster if you have installed the optional packages for Fast Parallel Extract module
# from discovermidi import fast_parallel_extract
# fast_parallel_extract.fast_parallel_extract()

# Load all MIDIs features matrixes and their corresponding MIDIs file names
features_matrixes, features_matrixes_file_names = discovermidi.load_features_matrixes()

# Run the search
# IO dirs will be created on the first run of the following function
# Do not forget to put your master MIDIs into created Master-MIDI-Dataset folder
# The full search for each master MIDI takes about 10-25 seconds on a GPU
discovermidi.search_and_filter(features_matrixes, features_matrixes_file_names)
```
