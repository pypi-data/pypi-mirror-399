**A CLI coding assistant by [qynon](https://t.me/qynon).**

Decoder is a command-line coding assistant powered by various AI models. It provides a conversational interface to your codebase, allowing you to use natural language to explore, modify, and interact with your projects through a powerful set of tools.

> [!WARNING]
> Decoder works on Windows, but we officially support and target UNIX environments.

### Installation

**Using uv (Recommended)**

```bash
uv tool install decoder
```

**Using pip**

```bash
pip install decoder
```

## Features

- **Animated Splash Screen**: A beautiful typing animation and interactive welcome screen.
- **Interactive Chat**: A conversational AI agent that understands your requests and breaks down complex tasks.
- **Powerful Toolset**: A suite of tools for file manipulation, code searching, version control, and command execution.
  - Read, write, and patch files (`read_file`, `write_file`, `search_replace`).
  - Execute shell commands in a stateful terminal (`bash`).
  - Recursively search code with `grep`.
  - Manage a `todo` list to track progress.
- **Project-Aware Context**: Automatically scans project structure and Git status.
- **Highly Configurable**: Customize models, providers, and themes via `config.toml`.
- **Safety First**: Tool execution approval for all destructive actions.

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to your project's root:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Run Decoder:
   ```bash
   decoder
   ```

3. Follow the onboarding to set up your API keys.

## Configuration

Decoder is configured via `config.toml` (located in `~/.decoder/config.toml`).
