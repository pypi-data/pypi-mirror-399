pdb_files = advanced_search_and_download_pdb(
    save_dir="data/pdb/kinases",
    organisms=["Homo sapiens"],
    methods=["X-RAY DIFFRACTION"],
    keywords=["kinase"],
    max_results=200
)
```

Notes

At least one search criterion must be provided.

Searches are performed using logical AND between groups and OR within each group.

The function returns a list of downloaded PDB file paths.

🧬 search_by_sequence_and_download_pdb

Search the PDB by protein sequence similarity and download corresponding structures.

This function leverages the RCSB sequence search service to retrieve structures that match a given amino acid sequence.
It is ideal when no PDB identifier is known a priori.

Example
```python 
from libraryPDB import search_by_sequence_and_download_pdb

sequence = "MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHM..."  # protein sequence
pdb_files = search_by_sequence_and_download_pdb(
    sequence=sequence,
    save_dir="data/pdb/sequence_hits",
    max_results=100
)

```

Notes

The input sequence must be provided as a raw amino acid string.

The function ignores unavailable or withdrawn PDB entries.

📌 Methodological considerations

These functions are designed to support:

Reproducible bioinformatics workflows

Large-scale structural analyses

Dataset generation for statistical or comparative studies

They intentionally avoid GUI interaction and manual curation steps, favoring automation, traceability, and scalability.


🧪 PDBio_utils — Low-level PDB file manipulation utilities

This module provides lightweight, dependency-free utilities for cleaning, standardizing, and preprocessing PDB files at the text level.

Unlike full structural parsers, these functions operate directly on PDB records (ATOM / HETATM) and are designed to be:

Fast

Deterministic

Easily composable in pipelines

Safe for large-scale dataset processing

They are especially useful before descriptor computation, statistical analysis, or machine-learning–free workflows.

🔄 normalize_chain_ids

Non-standard or missing chain identifiers are mapped deterministically

Downstream tools expecting standard chain labels behave correctly

Typical use cases

Dataset harmonization

Preparing structures for batch analysis

If no Cα atoms are found, the structure is written unchanged.

Typical use cases

Structural comparison

Shape-based descriptors

Visualization normalization

📌 Typical use cases

PDBquality is commonly used to:

Exclude NMR ensembles

Remove multi-chain complexes

Detect structures with alternate conformations

Document dataset quality in publications

Example:
```python
