# Hud Python SDK

**Hud is a Runtime Code Sensor that understands your code's behavior in production, helping engineers and coding agents build production-safe code.**

---

## Why Hud

`hud-sdk` is a lightweight, low-overhead runtime sensor for production code. Installed in under a minute, it captures real-time behavior of every function in your service - including performance characteristics, error behavior, and execution patterns. This data powers Hud’s production-aware development tools across IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, and code-generating agents like Cursor and Copilot.

Hud provides continuous visibility without requiring logs, traces, or dashboards - directly from your IDE.
