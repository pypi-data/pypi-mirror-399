# QPhase 2.0 System Configuration
# --------------------------------
# This file contains system-wide configuration parameters that affect
# the behavior and semantics of the entire QPhase system.
#
# These parameters are NOT intended to be casually modified by end users.
# They control global defaults and system behavior.

# Path configuration
paths:
  # Default output directory for simulation runs
  # Relative paths are resolved against the current working directory
  output_dir: "./runs"

  # Path to the global plugin configuration file
  # This file contains plugin registrations and global plugin settings
  global_file: "./configs/global.yaml"

  # Paths to scan for plugin configuration files
  # Each directory will be searched for .qphase_plugins.yaml files
  plugin_dirs:
    - "./models"  # Project root models folder for user plugins

  # Directories to search for configuration files and job templates
  config_dirs:
    - "./configs"

# Automatic result saving
# When enabled (default), the scheduler will automatically save job results
# to disk after each job completes. Set to false to disable automatic saving
# (results will only be passed to downstream jobs in memory).
auto_save_results: true

# Parameter scan configuration
# Controls how lists in configurations are expanded into multiple jobs
parameter_scan:
  # Enable parameter scan expansion (default: true)
  # When enabled, fields marked as "scanable" with list values will be expanded
  enabled: true

  # Expansion method: 'cartesian' (all combinations) or 'zipped' (aligned lists)
  # cartesian: [a1, a2] × [b1, b2, b3] = 6 jobs
  # zipped: [a1, a2] + [b1, b2] = 2 jobs (must have same length)
  method: "cartesian"

  # Automatically number outputs from expanded jobs
  # job_name -> job_name_001, job_name_002, etc.
  numbered_outputs: true
