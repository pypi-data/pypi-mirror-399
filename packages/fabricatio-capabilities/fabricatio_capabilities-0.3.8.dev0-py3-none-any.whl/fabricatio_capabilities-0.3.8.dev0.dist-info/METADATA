A foundational Python library providing core capabilities for building LLM-driven applications using an event-based
agent structure.

## 📦 Installation

This package is part of the `fabricatio` monorepo and can be installed as an optional dependency using either pip or uv:

```bash
pip install fabricatio[capabilities]
# or
uv pip install fabricatio[capabilities]
```

For a full installation that includes this package and all other components of `fabricatio`:

```bash
pip install fabricatio[full]
# or
uv pip install fabricatio[full]
```

## 🔍 Overview

Provides core capabilities for content extraction, proposal generation, task execution, and quality assessment in
LLM-driven applications. The package enables structured information gathering, intelligent decision-making, and
comprehensive workflow management with built-in evaluation systems.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Extract Capability**: Extract structured information from unstructured text using advanced NLP techniques
- **Propose Capability**: Generate proposals and suggestions based on context and available data
- **Task Management**: Execute and manage complex workflows with dependencies and status tracking
- **Rating System**: Evaluate content quality and effectiveness using predefined metrics
- **Type Models**: Pydantic-based models for consistent data structures and validation
- **Async Support**: Built-in asynchronous execution with Rust extensions for performance
