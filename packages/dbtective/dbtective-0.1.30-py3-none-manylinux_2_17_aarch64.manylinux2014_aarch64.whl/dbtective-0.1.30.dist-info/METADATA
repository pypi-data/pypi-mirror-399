# 🕵️ dbtective

dbtective is a Rust-powered 'detective' for `dbt metadata` best practices. As your dbt project grows, keeping metadata consistent and high-quality can become a real challenge.

![CLI demo](/docs/static/demo.gif)

Explore the [full documentation](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs) or the [possible rules](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/rules).

> [!WARNING]
> dbtective is currently in very early stages.
> Issues and commits are more than welcome!

**dbtective** makes it easy to spot and fix common issues, examples:

- **Missing descriptions:** Does every model and seed have a description?
- **Column types:** Are all columns explicitly typed?
- **Ownership:** Do all sources have an owner?
- **Naming conventions:** Are all marts following your team's naming standards?

We detect and enforce these rules in your `cli`, `prek`/`pre-commit` and `CI/CD` pipeline, so fast you will barely notice🕵️.

## Installation

<details>
<summary>Pip (pypi)</summary>

```bash
pip install dbtective
```

</details>

<details>
<summary> uv </summary>

Install as a dev dependency:

```bash
uv add dbtective --dev
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Homebrew</summary>

```bash
brew install feliblo/tap/dbtective
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>GitHub Actions</summary>

Run dbtective as part of your CI/CD pipeline. See the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/running/github-actions) for more details.

```yaml
- uses: feliblo/dbtective@v0.1.29
  with:
    config-file: "dbtective.yml"
    entry-point: "."
    only-manifest: "true"
    verbose: "false"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>prek/pre-commit</summary>

Prerequisite: `dbtective` is installed via one of the methods above.

We (currently) recommend using the `--only-manifest` flag with prek/pre-commit to avoid issues caused by `catalog.json` mismatches. For more details, see the explanation in the [rules documentation](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/rules).

Add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/feliblo/dbtective
    rev: v0.1.29
    hooks:
      - id: dbtective-run
        args: [--only-manifest]
```

And run

```bash
prek install
prek run --all-files
# or with pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files

```

## Quickstart

All possible rules can be found in the [rules documentation](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/rules). Information about customizing `dbtective` is shown at the [config documentation](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/config)

1. Create a `dbtective.yml` config file in the root of your dbt project by running:

More about the `init` (it also supports `pyproject.toml` or `dbtective.toml`) command is available in the [init documentation](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/running/cli#dbtective-init).

```bash
dbtective init
```

Inspect the contents of the generated `dbtective.yml` file and modify it to fit your project's needs.

1. (Optional) Generate the dbt manifest and catalog files if you haven't done so already. Most dbt commands automatically generate the `manifest.json`, but if you want to ensure both files are up to date, run:

```bash
dbt compile
dbt docs generate
```

1. Run `dbtective` in the root of your current directory or specify an entry point if your dbt_project is not located in the root/current drectory.

```bash
dbtective run
dbtective run --entry-point "my_dbt_project"
```

1. Review the output and fix any issues found.

2. (Optional) Integrate `dbtective` into your CI/CD pipeline or pre-commit hooks to automate rules on every commit and/or pull request.
