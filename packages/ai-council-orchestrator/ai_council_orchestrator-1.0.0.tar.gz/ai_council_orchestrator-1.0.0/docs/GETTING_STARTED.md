## 🎯 Your First AI Council Request

Let's start with a simple example:

### 1. Create Your First Script

Create a file called `my_first_ai_council.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
My First AI Council Example
"""

from ai_council.factory import AICouncilFactory
from ai_council.core.models import ExecutionMode

def main():
    print("🚀 Initializing AI Council...")
    
    # Create AI Council instance
    factory = AICouncilFactory()
    ai_council = factory.create_ai_council_sync()
    
    # Your first request
    question = "What are the main benefits of renewable energy?"
    
    print(f"❓ Question: {question}")
    print("🔄 Processing...")
    
    # Process the request
    response = ai_council.process_request_sync(
        question,
        ExecutionMode.BALANCED
    )
    
    # Display results
    print("\n" + "="*50)
    print("📝 AI Council Response:")
    print("="*50)
    print(response.content)
    print(f"\n📊 Confidence: {response.overall_confidence:.2f}")
    print(f"🤖 Models Used: {', '.join(response.models_used)}")
    print(f"💰 Cost: ${response.cost_breakdown.total_cost:.4f}")
    print("="*50)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 2. Run Your First Script

```bash
# Set Python path (Windows)
$env:PYTHONPATH = "."

# Run your script
python my_first_ai_council.py
```

You should see output like:
```
🚀 Initializing AI Council...
❓ Question: What are the main benefits of renewable energy?
🔄 Processing...

==================================================
📝 AI Council Response:
==================================================
Renewable energy adoption offers significant environmental benefits and long-term economic advantages, though initial costs and infrastructure challenges must be considered.

📊 Confidence: 0.88
🤖 Models Used: model-1, model-2, model-3
💰 Cost: $0.0210
==================================================
```

## 🎮 Try Different Execution Modes

Now let's explore the different execution modes:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Exploring AI Council Execution Modes
"""

from ai_council.factory import AICouncilFactory
from ai_council.core.models import ExecutionMode

def compare_execution_modes():
    factory = AICouncilFactory()
    ai_council = factory.create_ai_council_sync()
    
    question = "Explain machine learning in simple terms"
    
    modes = [
        (ExecutionMode.FAST, "🚀 FAST"),
        (ExecutionMode.BALANCED, "⚖️ BALANCED"), 
        (ExecutionMode.BEST_QUALITY, "💎 BEST_QUALITY")
    ]
    
    print(f"Question: {question}\n")
    
    for mode, mode_name in modes:
        print(f"--- {mode_name} MODE ---")
        
        # Get cost estimate first
        estimate = ai_council.estimate_cost_and_time(question, mode)
        print(f"💰 Estimated Cost: ${estimate.total_cost:.4f}")
        print(f"⏱️  Estimated Time: {estimate.total_time:.1f}s")
        
        # Process request
        response = ai_council.process_request_sync(question, mode)
        
        print(f"📊 Confidence: {response.overall_confidence:.2f}")
        print(f"💵 Actual Cost: ${response.cost_breakdown.total_cost:.4f}")
        print(f"📝 Response: {response.content[:100]}...")
        print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compare_execution_modes()
```

## 🔍 Understanding the Results

When AI Council processes your request, you get:

### Response Object

- **`models_used`**: Which AI models were involved
- **`cost_breakdown`**: Detailed cost information
- **`execution_metadata`**: Processing details

### Confidence Scores
- **0.9-1.0**: Very high confidence, reliable answer
- **0.7-0.9**: Good confidence, generally trustworthy
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderate confidence, consider verification
- **0.0-0.5**: Low confidence, requires careful review

response = ai_council.process_request_sync(
    "Write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers",
    ExecutionMode.BALANCED
)

# Research and analysis  
response = ai_council.process_request_sync(
    "Research the latest developments in quantum computing",
    ExecutionMode.BEST_QUALITY
)

# Creative writing
response = ai_council.process_request_sync(
    "Write a short story about AI and humans working together",
    ExecutionMode.BALANCED
)
```

### 3. Learn About Configuration

from ai_council.utils.config import load_config

# Load and examine the configuration
config = load_config()
print(f"Available models: {list(config.models.keys())}")
print(f"Execution modes: {list(config.execution_modes.keys())}")
```

### 4. Explore Advanced Features

- **Custom Configuration**: Create your own execution modes and routing rules
