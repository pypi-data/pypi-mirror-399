# Position 1 Carry Analysis Framework

## Role Definition
The carry's job is to maximize farm efficiency while minimizing deaths, hitting item timings that enable team fight contribution, and converting advantages into objectives. A good carry doesn't just farm - they farm with purpose and transition cleanly into fight participation.

## Core Philosophy
**"Patience wins games. Discipline closes them."**

The carry role is fundamentally about resource optimization:
- Every minute has optimal gold/XP activities
- Every death costs not just gold, but TIME and map pressure
- Item timings are checkpoints, not suggestions
- The transition from farming to fighting is the most critical decision

---

## CRITICAL: Early Game Evaluation (0-20 minutes)

**Low fight participation in the first 20 minutes is CORRECT and EXPECTED.**

### What to Evaluate (0-20 min)
| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| CS/min | Direct measure of farming execution |
| Deaths | Each death = lost farm time + gold |
| Item timing vs benchmark | Are they hitting power spikes? |
| Farming pattern | Wave-camp-wave, not AFK jungle |
| Lane equilibrium | Did they control the wave? |

### What NOT to Evaluate (0-20 min)
| Metric | Why It's Irrelevant |
|--------|---------------------|
| Kill participation | Pos1 shouldn't be fighting yet |
| Team fight presence | Carry joins AFTER timing, not before |
| Rotation frequency | Zero rotations is often correct |
| Assists | Farm > assists pre-timing |

### The Timing Rule
**Fight participation becomes relevant ONLY after:**
1. First major item completed (BF, Maelstrom, Manta, etc.)
2. Level 12+ (second ultimate point)
3. BKB online (for most carries)

Until then, a carry with 0% kill participation but 70 CS at 10 min is playing CORRECTLY.
A carry with 40% kill participation but 45 CS at 10 min is playing INCORRECTLY.

### Team Fight Before Timing = RED FLAG
If carry is joining fights at 12-15 minutes without completed items:
- Either team is forcing bad fights they can't win without carry
- Or carry is making positioning errors that get them involved
- **Exception**: Cleanup kills within farming route (no deviation)

---

## Phase 1: Laning (0-10 minutes)

### Lane Equilibrium - THE Core Laning Concept
The first wave determines the next 5 minutes. Get this wrong and the lane spirals.

**Critical Rules:**
1. **First two waves: Do NOT A-click enemy heroes**
   - Causes creep aggro, pushes wave into enemy
   - Wave pushing = offlaner farms safely, you get zoned

2. **Keep wave near YOUR tower, not enemy's**
   - Close to tower = safe farm
   - Deep in enemy territory = gank target

3. **If wave pushes (mistake happens):**
   - Use aggro manipulation to drag creeps back
   - Aggro enemy melee onto YOUR ranged creep (melts fast)
   - Keep aggroing backwards until wave resets

4. **Never let range creep hit enemy tower**
   - Tower last-hitting = your wave dies faster = push

### Patience and Positioning
**"Sometimes the correct move is literally nothing."**

- Walk IN for CS, walk OUT immediately
- Don't stand in the wave
- No action should cost >25-50% of your health
- If support is away: Relax, soak XP, deny if safe

### Lane Dynamics Assessment
| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 2v1 (you advantaged) | Trade aggressively |
| 2v2 with HP/level advantage | Trade |
| 1v1 even | Farm, trade opportunistically |
| 1v2 (you disadvantaged) | **Wait**, soak XP, spell-CS only |

### Recognizing Laning Phase End
**The lane is OVER when:**
- Offlaner hits level 6-7 (kill potential spikes)
- Usually minutes 6-10
- You've been killed 2+ times in lane

**Transition Action:**
1. Shove the wave into tower
2. Pull small camp near your tower
3. Move to jungle farming pattern

---

## Phase 2: Farming (7-25 minutes)

### The Farming Pattern
**Wave → Jungle → Wave → Jungle**

This is the fundamental loop. Creep waves are worth MORE than jungle camps.

| Source | Gold Value |
|--------|------------|
| 1 Creep Wave | ~200g |
| 1 Medium Camp | ~70-90g |
| 1 Large Camp | ~100-150g |

**Key Insight:** To match 1 wave, you need 2 medium-large camps PLUS walking time.

### Camp Prioritization Hierarchy
1. **Safe pushed lanes** (waves bouncing back)
2. **Ancients** (after farming item)
3. **Triangle camps** (default safe position)
4. **Nearby lane camps**

### Timer Awareness
| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| :40-:45 | Stack ancients if in route |
| :00 | Camps spawn - be at a camp to "spawn farm" |
| 14:00 | XP Shrine ready - incorporate into route |
| 21:00 | Second XP Shrine timing |

### TP Scroll Usage
Pre-BKB/Pre-item timing:
- TP aggressively to push safe lanes
- TP for cleanup kills within route
- DON'T TP across map for risky fights

Post-BKB:
- Save TP for fight participation
- Use skill-based mobility for farming

### Item Timing Benchmarks
| Item | Good Timing | Struggling |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Maelstrom | 11-13 min | 16+ min |
| Battlefury | 12-14 min | 18+ min |
| BKB | 18-20 min | 24+ min |
| Manta | 20-23 min | 27+ min |

**20-minute checkpoint:** ~10,000 net worth is achievable with clean farming.

### XP Level Benchmarks
| Minute | Good Level |
|--------|------------|
| 10 | 10-11 |
| 15 | 13-15 |
| 20 | 16-18 |

---

## Phase 3: Fight Participation (Pre-BKB)

### Fight Selection Framework
**Only join "convenient" fights**

**GOOD fights (take these):**
- Low HP enemies near your farming route
- Cleanup kills after teammates engage
- TP kills when you have ultimate ready
- Fights within 5 seconds walk

**BAD fights (skip these):**
- Far across the map (30+ second walk)
- Uncertain outcome
- You don't have TP back
- Key threats not visible

### The Ultimate Rule
Many carries (Sven, Luna, Nature's Prophet, etc.) have fight-enabling ultimates.

**Pattern:**
1. Farm a camp
2. Press ult when fight starts elsewhere
3. TP to fight if good
4. If fight ends, ult helped farm anyway

---

## Phase 4: Mid-Game Transition (20-35 minutes)

### Active vs Passive Farming - CRITICAL CONCEPT
**AFK Farming = Games dragging to 50+ minutes = You are the problem**

| Passive Farming | Active Farming |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Farming opposite side of team | Farming near team |
| TPing back to fix lanes immediately | Assessing if fight will happen first |
| Missing team fights | Ready to join every fight |
| 30-40% kill participation | 60-70%+ kill participation |

### Post-Item Timing Rules
Once you have BKB + Core Item (Blink, Manta, etc.):
1. **Stop farming alone**
2. Farm camps NEAR teammates
3. Every BKB is a fight timer - use it to fight
4. Don't TP away from grouped team

### The 20-30 Second Rule
When lanes push into you:
1. **Don't immediately TP back**
2. Wait 20-30 seconds
3. Assess if fight will break out
4. Only leave after objective secured OR no fight happening

### Team Positioning
- Identify your strongest teammate
- Farm within their rotation
- Move WITH team direction, not against it
- If Necrophos is pushing mid, don't farm bot triangle

---

## Phase 5: Fight Execution

### Positioning Hierarchy
**"Let teammates absorb first hits."**

1. Enter fights AFTER initiation
2. Position at max attack range
3. Target supports/squishy heroes first
4. Reposition after ability usage

### Threat Identification
Every game, identify:
- Blink initiators (Axe, Legion, Magnus)
- Stun chains (Lion, Shadow Shaman)
- Global presence (Zeus, Nature's Prophet, Spectre)

**Rule:** If biggest threat is missing, don't show on dangerous part of map.

### Commit/Disengage Framework
**Commit when:**
- BKB active
- Teammates tanking
- Key enemy cooldowns used
- Survival item available (Satanic, Enrage, etc.)

**Disengage when:**
- BKB ends
- Teammates die
- Key enemy CDs come back
- Mana/HP critical

---

## Phase 6: Closing Games (25-45 minutes)

### Objective Conversion
After won fights:
1. **Push towers first** (not farm jungle)
2. If clean wipe → Roshan immediately
3. Aegis = 2.5 minutes of active pressure

### Aegis Usage
**"Aegis is a timer, not insurance."**

Wrong: Farm with Aegis, wait for perfect fight
Right: Push immediately, force fights, pressure

### The No-Throw Mentality
**Goal: End games with 2-3 deaths, not 7-8**

- Play "guaranteed" Dota
- Don't force risky high-ground without Aegis
- Protect lead instead of gambling it
- Second Aegis timing = game should end

### High Ground Push Checklist
- [ ] Aegis secured
- [ ] BKBs refreshed (or available)
- [ ] Lanes pushed in (all 3 if possible)
- [ ] Buybacks available
- [ ] Key enemy cooldowns tracked

## Replay Analysis Focus Areas

### What to Look For in Carry Replays

#### Laning Phase (0-10 min)
- [ ] Wave equilibrium: Does wave stay near safe tower?
- [ ] Aggro usage: Drawing creeps away from enemy?
- [ ] Death causes: Trading 1v2? Standing in wave? Overextending?
- [ ] Lane exit timing: Stayed too long against level 6?
- [ ] Regen management: Going to base unnecessarily?

#### Farming Phase (10-20 min)
- [ ] Pattern consistency: Wave-camp-wave or AFK jungle?
- [ ] Timer awareness: Stacking ancients? Hitting shrines?
- [ ] TP usage: Aggressive for waves or hoarding?
- [ ] Item timing vs benchmark: On time or behind?
- [ ] Deaths: Caught farming dangerous areas?

#### Transition (20-25 min)
- [ ] Grouping timing: Started playing with team post-BKB?
- [ ] Fight selection: Joining good fights, skipping bad?
- [ ] Map position: Farming near team or opposite side?
- [ ] Kill participation: 60%+ of team kills?

#### Team Fights (25+ min)
- [ ] Entry timing: Waiting for initiation?
- [ ] Positioning: Max range or frontlining?
- [ ] Target selection: Supports first?
- [ ] BKB usage: Every BKB = fight participation?
- [ ] Disengage: Recognizing when to back out?

#### Closing (30-45 min)
- [ ] Objective conversion: Pushing after fights?
- [ ] Aegis usage: Active pressure or passive farming?
- [ ] Death avoidance: Protecting lead?
- [ ] Game length: Closed cleanly or dragged?

## Common Analysis Mistakes (Pos1 Specific)

**NEVER say these wrong things when analyzing a carry:**

❌ "Carry only had 15% kill participation at 15 minutes"
✅ "Carry correctly prioritized farming - 70 CS at 10 min, Battlefury at 14 min"

❌ "Carry didn't help in the 12-minute fight"
✅ "Carry was still farming toward BKB timing - joining would delay power spike"

❌ "Carry should have rotated to help mid"
✅ "Carry correctly stayed farming - rotations cost CS and delay item timing"

❌ "Carry abandoned the team early"
✅ "Team's job is to create space for carry to farm - carry played correctly"

❌ "Carry had good KDA but low fight participation"
✅ "Evaluate early game by CS and item timing, not kills - KDA matters post-timing only"

---

## Analysis Anti-Patterns (DO NOT Criticize These)

**These are CORRECT carry behaviors that inexperienced analysts might criticize:**

### Early Game (0-20 min)
| Behavior | Why It's CORRECT |
|----------|------------------|
| 0-20% kill participation at 15 min | Carry is farming, not fighting - correct |
| Not TPing to a 12-minute team fight | Item timing not reached, farming is higher priority |
| "Abandoning" team during early skirmishes | Team should create space, not demand carry presence |
| Zero rotations to other lanes | Rotations cost farm, carry stays in lane/jungle |
| Not helping secure early Roshan | Unless cleanup opportunity, farm > risky Rosh |

### Mid Game (20-35 min)
| Behavior | Why It's CORRECT |
|----------|------------------|
| Farming during uncertain fights | Better to farm than die in coin-flip fight |
| Not joining fight without BKB | Dying without BKB = feeding, patience is correct |
| Waiting for cleanup instead of initiating | Carry is NOT the initiator |
| Farming near team instead of with team | Proximity ≠ participation, available if needed |

### What IS a Problem (Contrast)
| Actual Red Flag | Why It's Wrong |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Low CS AND low kill participation | Not farming, not fighting = doing nothing |
| Dying while "farming" early | Deaths negate farming benefit |
| Missing fights AFTER item timing | Has items, should be participating |
| Fighting early AND losing CS | Worst of both worlds |

---

## Red Flags in Carry Play

### Laning Problems
- Wave constantly at enemy tower (lost equilibrium)
- Multiple deaths to offlaner level 6 timing
- Farming at 5 CS/min (should be 7-9)
- Going to base with >50% HP (unnecessary)

### Farming Problems
- Maelstrom/BF later than 16 min (inefficient)
- AFK in jungle (not pushing waves)
- Missing ancient stacks (not timing)
- Not taking XP shrines (free resources)

### Transition Problems
- Still farming alone after 25 min with full items
- TPing away from grouped team to "fix lanes"
- <40% kill participation in 50+ min games
- Deaths to ganks while farming dangerous spots

### Fight Problems
- Entering before initiation (frontlining)
- Using BKB to farm/escape (not fighting)
- Not identifying threat cooldowns
- Chasing kills into fog

## Quick Reference: Carry Decision Tree

```
LANING:
Am I 2v1? → Trade
Am I 1v2? → Relax, soak XP
Is wave pushed? → Aggro back
Offlaner level 6? → Exit lane

FARMING:
Is there a safe wave? → Push it
Did camps spawn? → Farm them
Is it :40-:45? → Stack ancient
Am I 11-13 min? → Should have farming item

FIGHTING:
Do I have BKB?
  No → Only join cleanup kills
  Yes → Play with team, fight on cooldown

Is my team grouped?
  Yes → Farm near them
  No → Triangle/safe farm

CLOSING:
Won fight? → Push tower, not jungle
Have Aegis? → Force pressure immediately
Second Aegis? → This should end the game
```

## Hero-Specific Patterns

### Flash Farmers (Sven, Alchemist, Luna)
- 10-20 min: Pure farming window
- Come online at ~20 min with BKB/Blink
- Transition is sharp - farming to fighting immediately

### Late-Game Carries (AM, Void, Spectre)
- Need 25+ min to come online
- Manta + next item = fighting timing
- Can use Helm Dominator for creep stacks/pulls
- More patient transition

### Fighting Carries (Ursa, Troll, Lifestealer)
- Can fight earlier (15-20 min)
- Still need BKB for sustained fighting
- Don't skip farming phase entirely
- Balance: Farm when ult down, fight when ult up
