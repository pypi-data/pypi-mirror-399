# Position 2: Mid Lane Analysis Framework

## Core Philosophy
**"Laning is 70% CSing and 30% confidence."** - Sumail

The mid lane role is fundamentally about lane dominance and tempo creation:
- Excellent last hitting is BY FAR the most important skill
- Lanes are won wave by wave, not all at once
- Small advantages compound - every CS matters
- Your early game tempo determines the entire map state

---

## CRITICAL: Laning Phase Evaluation (0-10 minutes)

**Last hitting quality determines lane outcome more than anything else.**

### What to Evaluate (0-10 min)
| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| CS comparison vs opponent | Direct measure of lane dominance |
| CS timing precision | Are they getting contested CS? |
| Spell usage efficiency | Nuking for CS + harass simultaneously |
| Regen management | Did they sustain properly? |
| Deaths | Each death = massive XP/gold swing |

### What Indicates Good Laning
| Behavior | Why It's Correct |
|----------|------------------|
| CS advantage at minute 5/10 | Outplaying in fundamentals |
| Forcing enemy to base/miss waves | Lane control achieved |
| Trading harass WHILE getting CS | Not sacrificing farm for harass |
| Diving under tower when stronger | Pressing advantage correctly |

### The Sumail Principle
"Being really good at last hitting is by far the most important part of laning."
- Know how your damage looks on the HP bar
- Follow the creep attack that brings it to kill range
- Be so confident you KNOW you'll get the last hit

---

## Phase 1: Laning (0-10 minutes)

### The Fundamentals

#### Last Hitting Mechanics
1. **Know your damage range** - What does 50/60/70 damage look like on HP bar?
2. **Track which creep attack** puts enemy creep in kill range
3. **Chase the attack** - Your attack follows immediately after
4. **Timing > everything** - Perfect timing beats raw damage

#### Harass Philosophy
- **Never sacrifice CS for harass** - CS is main focus, harass is between CS
- **Ideal play**: Nuke for CS AND harass simultaneously
- **Mana management**: Don't run out, don't sit full - find balance per spell level
- **Don't force kills** - Take what's freely given, be oppressive without overextending

#### Creep Aggro Usage
- **DON'T defensive aggro when strong** - Pulling back gives up space
- **Identify urgent creeps** - 2-3 right clicks from spell kill threshold
- **Set creeps to spell threshold** - Then spell for CS + hit hero
- **Melee heroes** need more defensive aggro to avoid harass

### The Trading Pattern
1. Set creep to spell kill threshold
2. Cast spell to secure CS
3. Right-click enemy hero immediately after
4. Repeat - slowly building advantage

### Sustain Consistency (CRITICAL)
| Rule | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| Maintain 80%+ HP | Send salve/tango BEFORE you're dangerously low |
| Maintain 50%+ mana | Send mango/clarity when needed |
| Don't wait for rune | If rune is 40+ seconds away, send regen NOW |
| Ship items constantly | Stick components, stats - use courier efficiently |

**If you're low HP/mana with rune far away = send regen immediately**

### Tower Diving
When you have advantage (health, level, matchup):
- **Dive the enemy under tower**
- Learn tower aggro mechanics - don't draw aggro
- Fortify creeps to extend dive duration
- Missing dive opportunity = giving them time to recover

### Rune Control
- **DON'T leave for rune when you're stronger**
- Mirror enemy movement - if they go rune, follow; if they stay, stay and pressure
- Rune is a bait when you have kill potential in lane
- Power runes (2 min) > Bounty runes (3 min) for tempo

---

## Phase 2: Post-Laning / Early Game (10-20 minutes)

### The X Rotation Concept

After laning phase, mid has 4 route options:

#### Forward Routes (When Winning)
| Route | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| Enemy Jungle | Default after breaking mid tower - large area control |
| Enemy Triangle | Priority if they have flash farmer (Medusa, Luna, Sven) |

#### Backward Routes (When Losing/Even)
| Route | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| Your Jungle | Safe farm while waiting for opportunities |
| Your Triangle | If you can farm ancients (TA, OD, etc.) |

### Winning Lane Gameplan
1. **Break mid tower** - Opens forward routes
2. **Invade enemy jungle** - Farm their camps, ward high ground cliffs
3. **Push mid wave** - Always keep mid pushed
4. **Check for gank** - Can you kill safe lane carry?
5. **Rotate to triangle** - Take ancients, ward, check offlane gank
6. **Repeat** - Mid wave → jungle/triangle → check ganks → mid wave

### Ward Spots When Invading
**Always buy wards BEFORE invading (teammates might buy them out)**

Radiant Jungle:
- Jungle floor ward
- Jungle cliff ward

Radiant Triangle:
- Ancient cliff ward
- Sideshop cliff ward

Dire Jungle:
- Both jungle cliff wards

Dire Triangle:
- Rune cliff ward
- Ancient cliff ward

### Losing Lane Gameplan
1. **Stack your big camp** beside mid
2. **Bodyblock waves** for safer farm
3. **Aggro waves into tower** for faster/safer farm
4. **Farm jungle/ancients** between waves
5. **Wait for enemy to leave** - Then push their tower
6. **Transition to forward routes** once tower is down

---

## Phase 3: Mid Game Tempo (20-35 minutes)

### The 4 Conditions to Always Monitor

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| TP Counter Gank | Enemy diving your teammate? TP and clean up |
| Convenient Kills | Enemy support dewarding/stacking in your vision? Kill them |
| Power Runes (2 min) | Haste/DD/Invis = high kill probability |
| Bounty Runes (3 min) | Lower priority but good for bottle heroes |

### Ult Timing
- **Every ult can become a tower or gank**
- No ult = farm and push waves
- Ult ready = look for play on map
- Can't find play = use ult for tower pressure

### Item Timing Fights
- Pre-BKB: Take safe fights, don't force
- Post-BKB: Play extremely strong, force fights
- Post-Blink (initiation heroes): Be active, hunt kills

## Common Analysis Mistakes (Pos2 Specific)

**NEVER say these wrong things when analyzing a mid:**

**Low CS at 10 minutes:**

**Bad:**
- "Mid had good KDA"
- "Mid rotated to help team"

**Good:**
- "Mid had 52 CS at 10 min - poor farming focus in lane"
- "Mid rotated but lost 2 waves - should have pushed first"

**Harass vs Farm:**

**Bad:**
- "Mid should harass more"

**Good:**
- "Mid is harassing but missing CS - need to nuke for BOTH"

**Rune Priority:**

**Bad:**
- "Mid went for rune" (when they're winning lane)

**Good:**
- "Mid correctly ignored rune to pressure low HP enemy"

**Early Game Activity:**

**Bad:**
- "Mid is just farming"

**Good:**
- "Mid correctly farming until ult/item timing - then rotated for kill"

---

## Analysis Anti-Patterns (DO NOT Criticize These)

**These are CORRECT mid behaviors that might be misread:**

### Laning Phase (0-10 min)
| Behavior | Why It's CORRECT |
|----------|------------------|
| Ignoring rune when winning lane | Pressing advantage > rune gold |
| Not joining side lane fight | Mid's job is win lane, not TP to every fight |
| Diving enemy under tower | Correct when health/level advantage exists |
| Sending lots of regen | Sustain consistency wins lanes |

### Post-Laning (10-20 min)
| Behavior | Why It's CORRECT |
|----------|------------------|
| Farming enemy jungle after tower | Standard winning mid rotation |
| Not joining uncertain fights | Better to farm than coin-flip |
| Waiting for ult to rotate | Without ult, rotation value is lower |
| Buying wards as mid | Vision for invasion is mid's job |

### What IS a Problem (Contrast)
| Actual Red Flag | Why It's Wrong |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Low CS AND no kills | Not winning lane, not creating tempo |
| Missing CS while harassing | Sacrificing gold for HP damage |
| Going for rune when winning | Giving enemy time to recover |
| Never rotating with ult | Has tempo tool, not using it |
| Dying to ganks repeatedly | Map awareness / ward issue |

## Red Flags in Mid Play

### Laning Phase
- [ ] CS disadvantage at 5/10 minutes?
- [ ] Running out of mana/HP without sending regen?
- [ ] Missing CS to harass (not combining them)?
- [ ] Not diving when clearly stronger?
- [ ] Leaving rune when should be pressuring?

### Post-Laning
- [ ] Not pushing mid wave between rotations?
- [ ] No wards when invading enemy jungle?
- [ ] Missing obvious TP counter gank opportunities?
- [ ] Not using ult for 2+ minutes (without reason)?
- [ ] Falling behind in farm while "creating space"?

### Item Progression
- [ ] Delayed core items due to deaths?
- [ ] Wrong item order for game state?
- [ ] Not buying BKB when needed?

---

## Coaching Checklist

### Laning Analysis
- [ ] CS comparison at 5 and 10 minutes
- [ ] Did they combine nuke + harass effectively?
- [ ] Regen usage - did they send items in time?
- [ ] Did they dive when appropriate?
- [ ] Rune decisions - correct or baited?

### Post-Laning Analysis
- [ ] Which X rotation route did they take?
- [ ] Did they ward the invaded area?
- [ ] Mid wave management - kept pushed?
- [ ] Ult usage - tower/gank/wasted?
- [ ] Identified TP counter gank opportunities?

### Overall Impact
- [ ] Net worth at 10/15/20 minutes
- [ ] Towers taken / contributed to
- [ ] Kill participation when relevant (with ult/items)
- [ ] Did they create tempo or farm passively?

## Key Benchmarks

### CS Targets (Approximate)
| Time | Good | Excellent |
|------|------|-----------|
| 5 min | 30+ | 38+ |
| 10 min | 60+ | 75+ |
| 15 min | 90+ | 110+ |

### Power Spike Timings
| Item/Level | Expected Time |
|------------|---------------|
| Level 6 | 5:30-6:30 |
| Bottle + Boots | 3:00-4:00 |
| First core item | 12:00-15:00 |
| BKB (if needed) | 18:00-22:00 |

### Tower Pressure
- Mid tower should be pressured by level 7-8 if winning lane
- If enemy mid rotates, PUSH THEIR TOWER
- Every rotation they make = free tower damage for you
