# Position 5 Hard Support Analysis Framework

## Role Definition
The hard support is the team's caretaker - your job is to establish a "love relationship" with your carry, shielding them from threats while they farm toward their power spike. You have the lowest farm priority but highest responsibility for team coordination: calling objectives, managing vision, and ensuring your cores can flourish.

## Core Philosophy
**"Your carry's success IS your success. Protect the farm, enable the timing, win the game."**

The pos5 role is about sacrifice with purpose:
- Every consumable you buy saves your carry's gold
- Every ward placed is information for your entire team
- Every death should have meaning (trading, saving, objective)
- The best pos5 looks poor but the team looks rich

---

## CRITICAL: The Support Spectrum

### Babysitters vs Space Makers
Not all pos5 heroes play the same. Identify where your hero falls:

| Babysitters | Space Makers |
|-------------|--------------|
| IO, Oracle, Shadow Demon | Lion, Clockwerk, Enchantress |
| Stay tethered to carry | Play away from carry with playmakers |
| Save abilities are your identity | Catch/initiation is your identity |
| Position in front of carry when passive | Create pressure across the map |

### Middle Ground Heroes
| Hero | Why They're Flexible |
|------|---------------------|
| Ogre Magi | Bloodlust for carry, but fights well |
| Snapfire | Cookie save, but strong ultimate |
| Undying | Body block for carry, or frontline elsewhere |

### The Winning/Losing Modifier
| Game State | Adjustment |
|------------|------------|
| Winning | Even babysitters play away, close map out |
| Losing | Even space makers protect carry's farm zone |

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Game & Draft

### Pre-Game Block Decisions
| Camp | Priority |
|------|----------|
| Your small camp | UNBLOCK preemptively - you need it |
| Enemy hard camp | Block to deny their pulls |

**Sentry Investment:**
| Matchup | Sentry Strategy |
|---------|-----------------|
| Weak vs Strong lane | 2+ sentries, can't body contest |
| Even matchup | 1 sentry for your camp |
| Strong vs Strong | Prioritize fight items over sentries |

### Strong Laners to Pick
Treant Protector, Nature's Prophet, Vengeful Spirit, Warlock, Jakiro

### Weak Laners to Avoid (Unless Specific Draft Need)
Oracle, Omniknight (strong mid-game but poor lane presence)

---

## Phase 2: Laning (0-10 minutes)

### THE Core Concept: Creep Equilibrium
Keep the wave NEAR YOUR TOWER. Your carry farms safely. Offlaner is exposed.

| Wave Position | Assessment |
|---------------|------------|
| Near your tower | GOOD - carry safe, offlaner exposed |
| Middle of lane | Neutral - watch for spikes |
| Near enemy tower | BAD - carry exposed to dives |

### Pulling Fundamentals
| Pull Type | Timing | Use Case |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Small camp pull | :19, :49 | Standard equilibrium fix |
| Hard camp pull | :19, :49 | Stay closer to carry (current meta) |
| Stack pull | :54 | Full wave denied |

**Current Meta:** Hard pulls > small pulls because:
- You're closer to carry if they get jumped
- Strong laners punish you at small camp
- Faster return to fight

### NEVER Pull at These Times
**:48 or :50** - The lotus spawns at 3:00 and 6:00. Pulling at 2:48 or 5:48 means you miss contesting the lotus.

### Contest Enemy Pulls
Their pull timings: :17, :47 on hard camp

When they pull, you and carry can 2v1 their offlaner OR you go contest the pull.

### Last Hits ARE Your Priority
**Wrong mentality:** "I'm support, I don't last hit."
**Correct mentality:** "Last hits are priority, I'm just not THE priority."

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Range creep might get denied | Secure it with spell/attack |
| Two creeps dying, carry can only get one | Get the other one |
| Creep out of range for carry | You get it |
| Big neutral during pull | Spell to secure (worth the mana) |

### Harass Through AUTO-ATTACKS
**Spells are for securing kills, not harassing.**

| Phase | Primary Damage Source |
|-------|----------------------|
| Level 1-2 | Auto-attacks |
| Level 3+ | Auto-attacks + spell for kill |
| 50% HP enemy | Now commit spells for kill |

**Math:** Most heroes take ~25 auto-attacks to kill from full HP at level 1. Keep attacking.

### The Level 2 Power Spike
**9 creeps = Level 2** (2 waves + first melee of wave 3)

| If You Hit 2 First | If They Hit 2 First |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Go aggressive, 2 spells vs 1 | Play passive, give creep if needed |
| This often decides the lane | Wait for even footing |

**XP Note:** Shared XP rounds DOWN. Two heroes splitting 57 XP get 28 each (not 28.5). This is why solo XP matters.

### Focus Targets
1. Enemy carry (needs to farm, most punishing)
2. Enemy support (only if carry is safe)
3. DON'T split damage between both

---

## Phase 3: Objectives & Rotations

### Timer Checklist
| Time | Objective | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 2:20 | Single pull → push wave for 3 min lotus | Medium |
| 3:00 | Lotus spawn | HIGH |
| 5:20 | Single pull → push wave for 6 min lotus | Medium |
| 6:00 | Power rune for mid + Lotus | HIGH |
| 7:00 | Wisdom rune | HIGHEST |

### 6-Minute Rotations
If your lane is won and carry is safe:
1. Rotate to 6-minute power rune
2. OR use twin gate to gank enemy safe lane
3. Communicate: "I'm leaving, watch out"

### 7-Minute Wisdom Runes
**Most crucial early objective.**

| Outcome | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| You steal both | Level advantage, snowball |
| You trade 1-1 | Both supports hit 6 around 10 min |
| You lose both | XP deficit, must prioritize farm |

**Stealing Tactic:** At 6:15, place obs ward to spot enemy pos4. If they're there with stun, don't contest. Use that time to gank their offlaner instead.

### Mid Lane Support
- Water runes (2 min) - if convenient
- Power runes (6, 8, 10 min) - important if mid has bottle
- Bottle refill - ask "need bottle?" when you die/base
- Counter-gank - SAVE TP for this

**Mid laners tilt fastest. Help yours, tilt theirs.**

---

## Phase 4: Early Game (10-20 minutes)

### Hit Level 6 ASAP
**Benchmark:** Level 6 by 10-12 minutes

If you're behind, farm a lane or stand near stacks being cleared. Your ultimate is too important to delay.

### Play With Playmakers, Not Carry
| Who to Play With | Why |
|------------------|-----|
| Mid (Void Spirit, QoP) | They want to fight with ultimate |
| Offlaner (Axe, Mars) | They initiate, you follow |
| NOT carry | They're farming, you draw enemies TO them |

### Warding Philosophy
| Ward Type | Quantity | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Defensive (near carry) | 1 | Spot ganks on carry |
| Offensive (with team) | 2-3 | Enable plays where you're fighting |

**Deep wards are easier for pos4 to place.** Don't overextend for aggressive wards - it's fine to let pos4 handle those.

### The Map Split
After laning, the map typically splits diagonally:
- You take their safe lane area
- They take your safe lane area

Your ORIGINAL safe lane becomes dangerous farm. As pos5, YOU farm those dangerous waves your cores don't want.

---

## Phase 5: Mid/Late Game (20+ minutes)

### Positioning Rules
| Game State | Your Position |
|------------|---------------|
| Team passive/farming | In FRONT of carry (buffer zone) |
| Team aggressive/pushing | BEHIND cores (save/follow-up) |

**Never hit high ground.** Your cores hit buildings. You stand back with spells ready.

### Item Progression
| Priority | Items | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| 1st | Glimmer Cape, Force Staff | Save items always first |
| 2nd | Vessel, Atos, Eul's | Setup/counter items if needed |
| 3rd | Pipe, Mek | If no one else is building |
| Late | Refresher, Wind Waker, Hex | Team needs X, you provide X |

### Don't Be Proud of Being Poor
**Misconception:** "I'm a true support, I should be poor."
**Reality:** Farm dead waves, farm while stacking, there's gold everywhere.

Having Refresher/Wind Waker in late game can win fights. Don't sacrifice scaling for pride.

### Smoke Responsibility
**You are the smoke caller.** Ask yourself:
- Where are enemies?
- Can we kill someone?
- Roshan timing?

Buy smokes. Carry smokes. Call smokes.

### Buyback Usage
| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Rosh fight | Save buyback - you might need it |
| Getting picked | Consider aggressive buyback + TP to fight |
| Late game | ALWAYS have buyback |

You have the cheapest buyback and shortest death timer. Use it to turn fights.

---

## Phase 6: Late Game (40+ minutes)

### Ultimate-Dependent vs Utility-Dependent
| Ultimate Heroes | Utility Heroes |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Warlock, Silencer, Oracle | Ogre, Clockwerk, Snapfire |
| Stay FAR back, press R | Identify what team needs |
| Aghs/Refresher to enhance | Lotus/Hex/Pipe for team |

### Wave Cutting
After lost fights, CUT WAVES:
- Most teams can't break high ground without creeps
- You're expendable - if you die cutting, you respawn fast
- Buy time for cores to respawn

### Tier 5 Preparation (60 min)
Stack camps at 58-59 minutes. Clear immediately at 60:00. Get T5 neutrals before enemy. This wins ultra-late games.

## Replay Analysis Focus Areas

### Laning Phase (0-10 min)
- [ ] Small camp unblocked at start?
- [ ] Harassing through auto-attacks, not just spells?
- [ ] Secured range creep when carry couldn't?
- [ ] Lane equilibrium near tower?
- [ ] Level 2 timing (hit before enemy?)
- [ ] Lotus contested at 3/6 min?

### Rotation Phase
- [ ] At power rune for 6 min?
- [ ] Wisdom rune contested at 7 min?
- [ ] TP saved for counter-ganks?
- [ ] Twin gate used for safe lane gank?

### Early Game (10-20 min)
- [ ] Level 6 by 10-12 min?
- [ ] Playing with playmakers, not AFK with carry?
- [ ] Defensive ward for carry + offensive wards for team?
- [ ] Farming dangerous waves cores don't want?

### Mid/Late Game
- [ ] Correct positioning (front when passive, back when aggressive)?
- [ ] Not hitting buildings during siege?
- [ ] Smoke usage for picks/Roshan?
- [ ] Buyback saved for key fights?
- [ ] Late game items that team needs?

## Common Mistakes to Identify

### Laning Mistakes
| Red Flag | Why It's Wrong |
|----------|----------------|
| Zero auto-attacks on enemy carry | Not pressuring, they farm free |
| Spamming spells to harass | Wastes mana, should auto-attack |
| Small camp blocked at 1 min | Can't pull to fix lane |
| Pulling at :48 | Misses lotus timing |
| Splitting damage between both enemies | Neither dies, regen out |

### Rotation Mistakes
| Red Flag | Why It's Wrong |
|----------|----------------|
| Missing wisdom rune | Biggest early XP swing |
| No TP to counter-gank mid | Mid tilts, game spirals |
| Going base for regen constantly | Wasted time, buy regen ahead |
| Not at 6 min power rune | Missed tempo opportunity |

### Mid Game Mistakes
| Red Flag | Why It's Wrong |
|----------|----------------|
| Following carry everywhere after laning | Leeching XP, not making space |
| Zero smokes used by 20 min | Not coordinating team |
| Level 4-5 at 15 min | Not farming/stacking, can't contribute |
| "Warding" but obs still in inventory | Vision means PLACED wards |

### Late Game Mistakes
| Red Flag | Why It's Wrong |
|----------|----------------|
| Hitting high ground buildings | Wrong role, should be backing team |
| Dying first in fights (non-sacrifice) | Spells unused, team fights 4v5 |
| No buyback at 40 min | One pick = game over |
| "Poor man's pride" | Could have had impactful items |

---

## Analysis Anti-Patterns (DO NOT Criticize These)

### Correct Pos5 Behaviors That Might Look Wrong:
| Behavior | Why It's CORRECT |
|----------|------------------|
| Taking last hits carry couldn't reach | Securing gold for team |
| Dying to save carry | Trade deaths favor team |
| Low net worth | Farm priority is lowest |
| Not being near carry after 10 min | Making space with playmakers |
| "Stealing" dangerous lane farm | Cores don't want that farm anyway |

---

## Quick Reference: Pos5 Decision Tree

```
LANING:
Is wave near your tower?
  Yes → Harass enemy carry
  No → Pull to fix equilibrium

Is carry in danger?
  Yes → Position to trade/save
  No → Harass more aggressively

Approaching :19/:49?
  Lane pushed? → Pull
  Lane good? → Keep harassing

TIMINGS:
3:00/6:00 → Lotus
6:00 → Power rune + potential rotation
7:00 → Wisdom rune (HIGHEST priority)

EARLY/MID GAME:
Am I level 6?
  No → Farm somewhere, stack
  Yes → Play with playmakers

Where to ward?
  1 defensive (carry)
  2-3 offensive (where team plays)

Where to be?
  → WITH mid/offlaner when fighting
  → IN FRONT of carry when passive

LATE GAME:
Am I ultimate-dependent?
  Yes → Stay way back, don't die before R
  No → Identify team needs, buy that item

Lost fight?
  → Cut waves, buy time
```

## The 5 Game-Losing Mistakes

### 1. Wrong Priorities in Lane
**Problem:** Controlling camps but zero aggression.
**Fix:** Block camp, then HARASS. Both matter.

### 2. Staying Glued to Lane Too Long
**Problem:** Still in lane at 8 minutes when you could rotate.
**Fix:** By 5 minutes, look for rotation opportunities.

### 3. Not Playing Around Timings
**Problem:** Farming when your mid has ultimate + rune.
**Fix:** Track team power spikes. Use them together.

### 4. Not Being Efficient
**Problem:** Walking to base for regen, single-tasking.
**Fix:** Stack on way to rune. TP to base. Multi-task.

### 5. Auto-piloting
**Problem:** Same items/skills every game without thinking.
**Fix:** What does THIS game need? Build for that.
