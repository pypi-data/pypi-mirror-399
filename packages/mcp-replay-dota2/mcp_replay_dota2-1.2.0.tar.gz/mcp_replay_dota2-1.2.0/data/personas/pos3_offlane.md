# Position 3: Offlane Analysis Framework

## Core Philosophy
**"Win lane, control their jungle. Lose lane, farm triangle. Either way - SCALE."**

The offlane role is about creating space through pressure and denying enemy carry farm:
- Break enemy safe lane tower ASAP
- Control enemy jungle after tower falls
- Farm and scale until item timings
- Only group when you have the items to be effective

---

## CRITICAL: Early Game Evaluation (0-20 minutes)

**Offlaners must SCALE. Low fight participation before item timing is CORRECT.**

### What to Evaluate (0-15 min)
| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Lane outcome (tower broken?) | Primary offlane goal |
| CS and levels vs enemy carry | Are you denying their farm? |
| Deaths | Each death = space for enemy carry |
| Deep wards planted | Map control after tower |
| Enemy carry CS suppression | Did you disrupt their farm? |

### What NOT to Criticize
| Behavior | Why It's CORRECT |
|----------|------------------|
| Not rotating to other lanes | Their job is lane/area control |
| Low kill participation pre-blink | Waiting for item timing |
| Farming enemy jungle post-tower | This IS their job |
| Ignoring small skirmishes | Focus on scaling, not distractions |

---

## Phase 1: Laning (0-8 minutes)

### Primary Goals
1. **Secure CS and levels** - Deny enemy carry farm
2. **Harass enemy carry** - Force them to spend gold on regen
3. **Break enemy tower** - Opens forward control
4. **Don't die unnecessarily** - Deaths = enemy carry space

### Lane Control Techniques
| Technique | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| Creep aggro to ranged | Deny ranged creep before enemies arrive |
| Pull camp | Wave pushing too far out |
| Contest enemy pull | Don't let them fix equilibrium |
| Body block creeps | Control where lane meets |

### Trading Pattern
- Hit hero when you can, but prioritize CS
- Use spells for CS AND harass simultaneously (like mid)
- Keep regen coming - don't be low and vulnerable
- Play with your pos4 - follow up on their plays

### When to Push for Tower
| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Level 6 reached | Ult timing for tower damage |
| Enemy carry forced out | Free tower hits |
| Teammate rotates to help | Group for tower push |
| Enemy showing elsewhere | Safe to pressure |

---

## Phase 2: Post-Laning (8-20 minutes)

### Winning Lane Gameplan
After breaking enemy safe lane tower:

1. **Take over enemy jungle** - Farm their camps, deny carry farm
2. **Keep lane pushed** - Force carry to farm dangerous waves
3. **Plant deep wards** - Vision on enemy jungle/triangle
4. **Hunt the carry** - With smoke/detection if needed
5. **Wait for TP kills** - Watch map for counter-gank opportunities
6. **Farm and scale** - Don't just run around the map

### The Recovery Route (Losing Lane)
When you cannot break tower or approach wave:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Pull camp to reset wave equilibrium |
| 2 | Wait for wave to push back toward your tower |
| 3 | Farm triangle (if you can clear Ancients) or side jungle |
| 4 | Return to lane when wave arrives at your tower |
| 5 | TP to fights near towers if needed, otherwise FARM |

**Recovery Priority Order:**
- Ancients (Tide, Bristle, Timber, etc.) > Large camps > Medium camps
- Lane wave > Jungle camps (if safe to take)
- Always watch for lane pushing back to you

### Common Mistake: Getting Distracted
**DO NOT** leave your area to chase small fights across the map:
- You allow enemy carry to free farm
- You lose your tower and area control
- You fall behind in farm and levels
- You give enemy carry recovery space

**ONLY leave your area for:**
- TP counter-ganks where enemies are diving under tower
- Convenient kills along your farming route
- Using ult to take a tower (Death Prophet, etc.)
- Team commits to major objective (Roshan, HG push)

---

## Phase 3: Mid Game (15-25 minutes)

### Item Timing Rules
| State | Play Style |
|-------|------------|
| No blink/key item | Farm, push lanes, avoid risky fights |
| Blink ready | Start making plays, group with team |
| Ult ready | Play strong, look for fights |
| Ult on cooldown | Farm until ult returns |

### The Ult/No-Ult Pattern
| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Ult ready + team nearby | Look for fights, play aggressive |
| Ult ready + team far | Push lane, farm camps, watch for TP kills |
| No ult + key items | Can still fight but be careful |
| No ult + no items | Farm, push lanes, scale |

### Fighting Principles
| Rule | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Target backline supports | Squishy, high-value kills |
| With ult = fight to death | Get value from your ult |
| No ult = in-and-out | Cast spells and retreat |
| Don't frontline without initiation | You're a sitting duck |
| Use blink to engage, not chase | Close distance instantly |

---

## Analysis Anti-Patterns (DO NOT Criticize These)

**These are CORRECT offlane behaviors that might look wrong:**

### Laning Phase
| Behavior | Why It's CORRECT |
|----------|------------------|
| Dying 1-2 times in aggressive dives | Creating pressure, forcing rotations |
| Not helping distant fights | Lane control > random skirmishes |
| Sitting behind wave soaking XP | Losing lane, waiting for reset |
| Pulling your camp constantly | Fixing equilibrium |

### Post-Laning
| Behavior | Why It's CORRECT |
|----------|------------------|
| Farming enemy jungle alone | Standard winning offlane pattern |
| Not grouping until 18-20 min | Waiting for item timing (blink, etc.) |
| Low kill participation | Farming for power spike |
| Buying wards as pos3 | Vision for invasion is offlaner's job |
| Ignoring mid lane fights | Focus on own area control |

### What IS a Problem (Contrast)
| Red Flag | Why It's Wrong |
|----------|----------------|
| Low CS AND no tower damage | Not executing either win condition |
| Rotating to bad fights, missing farm | Getting distracted |
| Dying without ult | Wasted death, no value |
| Never breaking tower despite winning | Not converting lane advantage |
| Falling behind enemy carry in farm | Defeated purpose of offlane |

## Common Analysis Mistakes (Pos3 Specific)

**NEVER say these wrong things when analyzing an offlaner:**

**Low Fight Participation Early:**
- BAD: "Offlaner should join more fights"
- GOOD: "Offlaner correctly farmed until blink timing at 16 min"

**Farming Enemy Jungle:**
- BAD: "Offlaner is playing too passive"
- GOOD: "Offlaner controlling enemy jungle, denying carry farm"

**Not Rotating:**
- BAD: "Offlaner should TP to help bot lane"
- GOOD: "Offlaner correctly stayed to pressure enemy carry"

**Recovery Play:**
- BAD: "Offlaner gave up the lane"
- GOOD: "Offlaner correctly played triangle recovery route after losing lane"

## Red Flags in Offlane Play

### Laning Phase
- [ ] Tower not pressured despite winning lane?
- [ ] Dying without creating any pressure?
- [ ] Missing CS while neither harassing nor trading?
- [ ] Not pulling when equilibrium is bad?

### Post-Laning
- [ ] Leaving lane immediately after breaking tower?
- [ ] Not warding the area you're controlling?
- [ ] Chasing random fights across the map?
- [ ] Allowing enemy carry to free farm?
- [ ] Falling behind in levels?

### Mid Game
- [ ] Grouping without key items (blink, etc.)?
- [ ] Fighting without ult available?
- [ ] Not pushing out lanes before fights?
- [ ] Dying first in every fight?

---

## Coaching Checklist

### Laning Analysis
- [ ] CS comparison vs enemy carry
- [ ] Tower damage dealt / tower broken?
- [ ] Deaths - were they for value or wasteful?
- [ ] Enemy carry CS suppression achieved?

### Post-Laning Analysis
- [ ] Did they control enemy jungle after tower?
- [ ] Wards planted in enemy territory?
- [ ] Recovery pattern (if lane lost)?
- [ ] Maintained farm or fell off?

### Mid Game Analysis
- [ ] Item timings achieved?
- [ ] Started grouping at correct timing?
- [ ] Fight participation with ult vs without?
- [ ] Target selection in fights?

### Overall Impact
- [ ] Net worth at 10/15/20 minutes
- [ ] Enemy carry CS compared to theirs
- [ ] Towers taken / contributed to
- [ ] Deaths - with ult (acceptable) vs without (wasteful)?

## Key Benchmarks

### CS Targets (Approximate)
| Time | Good | Excellent |
|------|------|-----------|
| 10 min | 50+ | 70+ |
| 15 min | 80+ | 100+ |
| 20 min | 110+ | 140+ |

### Power Spike Timings
| Item/Level | Expected Time |
|------------|---------------|
| Level 6 | 5:00-6:00 |
| Phase Boots | 5:00-7:00 |
| Blink Dagger | 14:00-18:00 |
| BKB (if needed) | 18:00-24:00 |

### Tower Pressure
- Enemy T1 should be pressured by 7-10 minutes
- If you can't break tower, transition to recovery route
- Once tower falls, stay in area until blink/key item
