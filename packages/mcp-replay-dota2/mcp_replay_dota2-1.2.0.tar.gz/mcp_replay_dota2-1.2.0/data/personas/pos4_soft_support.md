# Position 4 Soft Support Analysis Framework

## Role Definition
The soft support is the team's early-game facilitator who has freedom to create impact across the map. Higher farm priority than pos5, the pos4 needs items like Blink Dagger to fully function. Your job is to figure out how your team wins the game and help push them down that path.

## Core Philosophy
**"Freedom comes with responsibility. Every minute you're not fighting, stacking, or warding - you're wasting your biggest advantage: mobility."**

The pos4 role is about efficient decision-making:
- You have the most FREEDOM of any role in the first 10 minutes
- That freedom means you must CHOOSE correctly
- Bad choices = wasted potential = team falls behind
- Two types: Initiators (Earthshaker, Tusk, Earth Spirit) and Damage Dealers (Skywrath, Dark Willow)

---

## CRITICAL: The Two Pos4 Archetypes

### Initiators (Melee/Gap-Closers)
| Hero Examples | Laning Style | Roaming Style |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Earthshaker, Tusk, Earth Spirit, Clockwerk | Focus on creep equilibrium, give offlaner XP advantage | Roam frequently, gank with long-range spells |

- Not the best laners - manipulate equilibrium instead
- Get lane to tower, then LEAVE
- Offlaner farms solo = level advantage for them
- You get blink/items, return for kills

### Damage Dealers (Ranged/Harass)
| Hero Examples | Laning Style | Roaming Style |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Skywrath, Dark Willow, Hoodwink | Heavy harass, kill potential | Stay in lane longer, leave for objectives |

- Stay in lane more, farm some XP
- Offlaner may be lower level but...
- You provide kill threat with ultimate
- Support damage secures kills, then offlaner catches up solo

## Phase 1: Pre-Game (Before 0:00)

### Pre-Game Smoke
**Smoke out of base EVERY GAME.** This enables:
1. Mid laner places obs undetected
2. Scout enemy movement/ward placement
3. Potential first blood opportunity
4. Information about enemy rotations

### Pre-Block Decisions
| Camp to Block | When/Why |
|---------------|----------|
| Enemy small camp | ALWAYS priority - prevents their pulls |
| Your hard camp | Unblock if you plan to pull |

**Block Timing:** Leave fountain FAST. Place sentry before enemies arrive. Most players don't preemptively deward - your block will stick.

### Ward Placement
You share warding duty with pos5. Deep wards are easier for you to place since you roam.

---

## Phase 2: Laning (0-10 minutes)

### First 30 Seconds - Wave Block
**Block the enemy wave behind their T1.** This is pos4's most impactful early play:
- Creeps meet near YOUR tower instead of theirs
- Enemy carry can't last hit under tower
- Tower kills their wave fast = push toward you
- Congrats, you just won equilibrium in 15 seconds

### Pull Camp Priority
| Your Hard Camp | Enemy Small Camp |
|----------------|------------------|
| Keep unblocked | Block with ward + body |

**Stack Pull Timing:** Hit hard camp at :54, pull toward enemy tower. Creates stack AND denies wave simultaneously.

### The Pull Camp War
When do you stop the sentry war?

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Neither has camp | Equal - no advantage either way |
| Both have camps | Equal - you pull, they pull |
| Only YOU have camp | Advantage - pull freely |
| Only THEY have camp | Disadvantage - invest sentries |

**Rule:** If matchup is close, having your hard camp is enough. If matchup is bad, block their camp at all costs.

### Harassing Priority
**Top 3 hero damage at 5 minutes** is a good benchmark for aggression.

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Harass enemy pos1 when pos5 leaves for deward |
| 2 | Contest pulls with offlaner (2v1 the pos5) |
| 3 | Trade with enemy pos5 if favorable |

### Leaving the Lane
**Prepare the lane before leaving:**
1. Get equilibrium near YOUR tower
2. Unblock your hard camp (offlaner can farm it)
3. Offlaner has survival tools (level 4+, escape spell, or tanky item)

**The #1 Pet Peeve of Offlaners:**
Don't sit behind your offlaner watching them farm when the lane is in a good spot. You did the hard part - now GO DO SOMETHING.

## Phase 3: Rotation Timings (5-10 minutes)

### Timer Checklist
| Time | Priority Objective |
|------|-------------------|
| 3:00 | Lotus spawn (worth 100+ gold in regen) |
| 4:00 | Water runes (if both mids have bottle) |
| 5:00 | Look for rotation opportunities |
| 6:00 | **Power runes - DEFAULT POSITION** |
| 7:00 | **Wisdom runes - #1 PRIORITY** |

### 6-Minute Power Runes
**If both mids build bottle, your default position at 6 minutes is at the rune, NOT in lane.**

A mid laner with ultimate + power rune (DD/Haste/Invis) is one of your biggest early game power spikes. Enable that.

### 7-Minute Wisdom Runes
**Number one priority.** Plan for this at 6 minutes:
- Set up lane so you're free to move
- Try to steal enemy's wisdom first
- TP back, then secure your own
- Stealing both = massive XP lead

### Stacking
**Double stack (Ancient + Hard) = 300g, 400xp.** That's equivalent to a hero kill.

| Consideration | Assessment |
|---------------|------------|
| Can hero farm stacks? | Some need BF timing, some can farm at 5 min |
| Is lane stable? | Don't leave offlaner for death |
| Stack priority | Ancients > Hard camps |

### Ganking Fundamentals
**Vision:**
- Place sentries to deward common spots
- Use smoke if you suspect ward coverage
- Wait for nighttime (reduced vision range)
- Approach from behind (enemy camera blind spot)

**Target Selection:**
- Someone who just respawned and TP'd back = best target
- Getting killed twice in a row destroys lane/morale
- Low HP heroes in your fog

---

## Phase 4: Early Game (10-20 minutes)

### Farm Priority
Pos4 has higher farm priority than pos5. You need items.

| Item Type | Examples | Why You Need It |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Blink Dagger | Initiators | Actually land ultimates |
| Force Staff | Versatile | Mobility + mana + save |
| Mek/Pipe/Vlads | Utility | Team sustain if no one builds |

### Where to Find Farm
1. Dead lanes (no core pushing)
2. Stacks you made earlier
3. Camps near where you're playing
4. Lane the mid vacated

### Post-Roam Recovery
If you fell behind from failed ganks:
- Hold a lane for your team
- Farm stacks
- Stand near stack while core farms it (shared XP)
- Organize smokes - kills give XP

### The Swap
**Don't be selfish about farm priority.** If your pos5 is having a monster game and items on them are more impactful, step back and let them have priority. You're here to win, not to farm.

---

## Phase 5: Mid/Late Game

### Movement Priority
1. Play with your playmakers (mid, offlaner)
2. Take fights away from your carry
3. Ward aggressively (deep wards easier for you)
4. Smoke initiation responsibility is often yours

### Fight Role
| Archetype | Role in Fight |
|-----------|--------------|
| Initiator | Blink in, land CC, soak initial damage |
| Damage Dealer | Stay back, follow up stuns, burst damage |

### Objective Timing
| Objective | Your Job |
|-----------|----------|
| Tormentor (20 min) | Call the timing, gather team |
| Roshan | Smoke initiation, ward pit approaches |
| High Ground | DON'T hit buildings - stay back with spells |

## Replay Analysis Focus Areas

### Laning Phase (0-10 min)
- [ ] Did they block enemy wave at game start?
- [ ] Was enemy small camp blocked?
- [ ] Hard camp available for pulls?
- [ ] Hero damage benchmark at 5 min (top 3?)
- [ ] Lane equilibrium near tower before leaving?

### Rotation Phase (5-10 min)
- [ ] At power rune for 6 minute spawn?
- [ ] Wisdom rune secured/contested at 7 min?
- [ ] Stacking on the way to objectives?
- [ ] Boots before rotations?
- [ ] Lotus secured at 3 min?

### Early Game (10-20 min)
- [ ] Blink/core item timing reasonable?
- [ ] Playing with playmakers, not carry?
- [ ] Deep wards placed?
- [ ] Smoke usage for ganks?

### Mid/Late Game
- [ ] Positioning correct for archetype?
- [ ] Objective calls (tormentor, rosh)?
- [ ] Not hitting buildings during siege?

## Common Mistakes to Identify

### Laning Mistakes
| Red Flag | Why It's Wrong |
|----------|----------------|
| Sitting behind offlaner when lane is good | Wasting time, leeching XP |
| No wave block at game start | Lost free equilibrium advantage |
| Enemy pull camp not blocked | They control equilibrium |
| Zero hero damage at 5 min | Too passive, not trading |
| Left lane with equilibrium at enemy tower | Offlaner can't farm safely |

### Rotation Mistakes
| Red Flag | Why It's Wrong |
|----------|----------------|
| Missing 6 min power rune | Biggest early tempo swing |
| Losing both wisdom runes | Massive XP deficit |
| No boots before roaming | Too slow, ganks fail, fall behind |
| Walking instead of using twin gate | Wasted time |
| Zero stacks entire game | Free value ignored |

### Itemization Mistakes
| Red Flag | Why It's Wrong |
|----------|----------------|
| 20+ min Blink on initiator | Can't do your job |
| Never buying sentries | "Warding is pos5's job" mentality |
| Items that don't help you farm/fight | Pos4 needs to scale |

---

## Analysis Anti-Patterns (DO NOT Criticize These)

### Correct Pos4 Behaviors That Might Look Wrong:
| Behavior | Why It's CORRECT |
|----------|------------------|
| Leaving offlaner alone 1v2 | Lane was stable, went for objectives |
| Lower level than pos5 | Roaming sacrifices XP for map impact |
| "Stealing" farm from cores | Dead lanes are pos4's farm |
| Failed gank attempts | Creating pressure matters even without kills |
| Low kill participation early | Stacking/warding is invisible impact |

---

## Quick Reference: Pos4 Decision Tree

```
PRE-GAME:
Smoke out of base? → YES, always
Block enemy small camp? → YES, sentry + body

LANING:
Is lane at your tower? → Harass, look to roam
Is lane pushed out? → Fix equilibrium first
Offlaner stable? → You can leave
Both camps blocked? → Lane is won, rotate

ROTATION TIMINGS:
:54 → Stack pull opportunity
3:00 → Lotus
6:00 → Power rune (default location)
7:00 → Wisdom rune (highest priority)

MID GAME:
Have Blink yet?
  No → Farm toward it
  Yes → Play with team, initiate fights

Where to play?
  → WITH mid/offlaner
  → AWAY from carry (create space)
```

## Creep Dragging (Advanced)

**Only use in DESPERATE matchups.** Only at Divine+ when both players understand the tactic.

The concept:
1. Aggro enemy wave behind their T1
2. Drag it to your side of map
3. Enemy carry gets free farm (they were anyway)
4. But now you BOTH get reduced farm = better for losing lane

**Requirements:**
- Both camps blocked (especially enemy small camp)
- Offlaner knows what's happening
- Matchup is unplayable otherwise

**Reality:** Most lanes aren't this bad. Playing normally and waiting for enemy mistakes is more consistent below Immortal.
