# Common Knowledge Framework

## Overview
This framework contains concepts that apply to ALL positions in Dota 2. These fundamentals should inform analysis regardless of the specific role being evaluated.

---

## Core Concept: Point of Contact

### Definition
The "point of contact" is the hero on your team who SHOULD be initiated on (or should initiate) in any given fight. This shifts based on:
- Draft composition
- Current item timings
- Game phase
- Enemy catch/burst potential

### How It Affects Play

| If You ARE Point of Contact | If You Are NOT Point of Contact |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Position yourself forward | Position BEHIND point of contact |
| Buy survivability items | Buy damage/utility items |
| Show on waves to bait | Farm off-map, join fights late |
| Expect to absorb cooldowns | Save your spells for cleanup |

### Common Shifts
- **Early game**: Usually your tanky frontliner (Axe, Bristle, Centaur)
- **Mid game**: Can shift to whoever has BKB/survivability first
- **Late game**: Often your initiator with Blink (Tide, Magnus, Enigma)
- **When losing**: Supports may become point of contact to create space

### Itemization Based on Point of Contact
| Point of Contact Role | Key Items |
|----------------------|-----------|
| I AM point of contact | Blink, BKB, Shiva's, Pipe, survivability |
| I am NOT point of contact | Damage items, save items, positioning items |

**Key Insight**: If you're a tanky hero but CAN'T be point of contact (enemy has burst/catch that counters your survivability), buy Blink Dagger to control your engagement timing.

## Core Concept: Timer & Minimap

### The Foundation of Dota
Everything in Dota operates on a strict timer. The two most important things on your screen:
1. **The Timer** - Tells you when resources become available
2. **The Minimap** - Tells you where resources are and where enemies are

### Key Timers to Track

| Timer | Event | Priority |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Every 30 sec | Creep waves spawn | HIGH |
| Every 1 min | Jungle camps respawn | HIGH |
| Every 2 min | Power runes spawn | MEDIUM |
| Every 3 min | Lotus pools spawn | MEDIUM |
| Every 4 min | Bounty runes spawn | LOW |
| Every 5 min | Siege creeps spawn | MEDIUM |
| Every 7 min | Wisdom runes spawn | HIGHEST |
| 20 min | Tormentor spawns | HIGH |
| Variable | Roshan respawn (8-11 min) | HIGH |

### When to Check the Timer
1. **When finishing a creep wave** - Know what's spawning next
2. **When leaving your lane** - Plan your route around spawns
3. **When entering/leaving jungle camps** - Stack opportunities
4. **After fights/objectives** - Reset farming pattern efficiently

## Core Concept: Expectations vs Reality (Tilt Management)

### Why Tilt Happens
Frustration occurs when your expectations do not match reality. You expect teammates to:
- Know what you know
- Prioritize what you prioritize
- Play the way you think is correct

**Reality**: Different players have completely different priorities and knowledge.

### The Exercise
When asked "What are the 5 fundamentals every Dota player should know?", 13 experienced players gave **40+ unique answers** across 9 categories. If experienced players can't agree on fundamentals, why expect your pub teammates to share your priorities?

### Managing Tilt
| Trigger | Reframe |
|---------|---------|
| "My carry isn't fighting" | "They might have a different game plan" |
| "Support isn't warding" | "They may prioritize something else" |
| "No one is listening to me" | "My communication may not be effective" |

**Key Insight**: You will get frustrated when people don't care about what you care about. Accept this is human nature and focus on what YOU can control.

## Core Concept: Ganking Principles

### The Resource Check
Before considering any gank, evaluate:
1. **Mana** - Can I cast all necessary spells?
2. **HP** - Can I survive if it goes wrong?
3. **Cooldowns** - Are my key abilities ready?

### Hero Identity Questions
Ask yourself about YOUR hero:
- Does my hero push lanes fast? (More freedom to roam)
- How does my hero kill? (Catch vs damage vs both)
- Who do I interact well with? (Combos that cover weaknesses)
- Who do I interact poorly against? (Don't force bad matchups)

### Forced vs Unforced Ganks

| Forced Ganks | Unforced Ganks |
|--------------|----------------|
| Wave pushing into tower | Random rotation |
| Enemy MUST respond or lose something | Enemy can just back up and wait |
| Wisdom rune fights | Walking to a lane with no wave pressure |
| High success rate even without kills | Rely on enemy mistakes |

**Best Ganks**: Time your rotation WITH a big wave pushing into enemy tower. Even if they dodge, they lose the wave.

### Target Selection Priority
1. **Stack farmers** (Sven, Beastmaster, Timber) - Huge economic impact
2. **Late-game carries** (Medusa, Luna, Spectre) - Delays their timing
3. **Lane dominators** (Viper, Razor) - One death can salvage your laner
4. **Ranged heroes** - Generally easier to kill than melee

**Avoid Ganking**: Heroes that want to fight (Undying, Bristle), heroes that respawn fast, heroes that are already behind.

---

## Core Concept: Patience & Discipline

### The Core Problem
When your team is ahead but can't find kills:
- Teammates pressure you to "do something"
- You feel like you're wasting the lead
- Impatience leads to overextension and throws

### The Solution
**Not every game needs constant action.** Sometimes the correct play is to:
- Farm efficiently
- Don't force fights
- Wait for THEIR mistakes
- Maintain vision control

### When to Be Patient
- Your draft lacks catch/stuns
- Enemy has strong defense (saves, highground)
- You're close to a key item timing
- Your initiator doesn't have Blink yet

### Damage Control
When fights go badly:
- DON'T run in to "help" and die too
- Push waves on the opposite side of the map
- Minimize what the enemy gets from wins
- Cut waves to delay pushes

**Key Insight**: "I just think we have to keep doing nothing" is sometimes the correct mindset. The game that feels like "nothing is happening" can be won through discipline, not action.

---

## Core Concept: Positioning (Circle of Safety/Aggression)

### The Circle Concept
Your attack range creates a "circle" around your hero:
- **Circle of Safety**: Stay at max range, poke enemies who enter
- **Circle of Aggression**: When ahead/stronger, step INSIDE to threaten

### Ranged vs Melee Trading

| As Ranged Hero | As Melee Hero |
|----------------|---------------|
| Keep enemies at circle edge | Close gap with abilities/items |
| Attack when they enter range | Force trades inside your range |
| Run when they get too close | Use fog/trees to approach |
| Turn rate costs YOU more | Turn rate costs THEM more |

### Key Positioning Rules
1. **Free damage**: Attack when enemy is at edge of your range, can't retaliate
2. **Turn rate tax**: Every turn costs ~0.1 sec. Minimize direction changes.
3. **Kite forward**: Attack while chasing to maximize damage
4. **Commit or retreat**: Don't half-ass trades (turn, attack, turn back repeatedly)

### Support Positioning
- **Max cast range from your priority target**
- **Behind your cores, not next to them**
- **In trees/fog when possible**
- **Consider enemy initiation ranges (Blink = 1200 units)**

## Core Concept: Build Consistency

### The Problem
Your items, skill build, and playstyle can CONTRADICT each other, making you ineffective at everything.

### Common Contradictions

| Contradiction | Why It's Bad |
|---------------|--------------|
| Pushing wave but not pulling | Lane pushes, carry farms dangerously |
| Full mana + buying mana regen | Wasting gold on non-problems |
| Max battle hunger + Blade Mail rush | Aggressive skills + defensive item |
| Fighting build + no boots | Can't execute the playstyle |

### The Fix
Before buying items, ask:
1. What is my problem RIGHT NOW?
2. What do I want to DO NEXT?
3. Does this item help with either?

### Skill Build Checklist (Pre-Game)
For each ability, consider:
- Which enemies is it good/bad against?
- When do I need this spell? (Level timing)
- Does skipping it cost me in specific matchups?

## Core Concept: Decision Timing

### When to Think Critically
Certain moments REQUIRE active decision-making. Don't autopilot through:

| Moment | Decision Required |
|--------|-------------------|
| Two range creeps in lane | Don't leave, farm efficiently |
| Creeps entering your tower | Pull them out or aggro to control lane |
| Pre-game/draft | Assess spell importance vs enemy heroes |
| Entering mid lane | Which half of map do I go to next? |
| XX:50 on timer | Stack opportunity, camp spawns soon |

### Mid Lane Crossroads Decision Tree
```
Entering mid lane:
├── Are enemies dead?
│   └── YES → Go to most efficient farm area
│   └── NO → Continue below
├── Where will the fight likely be?
│   └── Top half or Bottom half (based on heroes, Rosh, Tormentor)
├── Do I want to fight?
│   └── YES → Go toward likely fight area
│   └── NO → Go AWAY from likely fight area
```

### The Two Range Creep Rule
When you have two range creeps in your wave:
- Creeps die VERY fast
- Do NOT leave lane for trades/ganks
- Missing this = enemy denied entire wave worth of XP/gold

---

## Analysis Integration

### When Reviewing Any Replay, Consider:

1. **Point of Contact Errors**
   - Was the player positioning as if they were point of contact when they shouldn't be?
   - Did they itemize for their role in fights?

2. **Timer Awareness**
   - Did they miss obvious spawn timings?
   - Were they positioned for key objectives (wisdom runes, Roshan)?

3. **Tilt Indicators**
   - Did plays get worse after teammates made mistakes?
   - Were they forcing plays out of frustration?

4. **Gank Decision Quality**
   - Were ganks forced (with wave pressure) or unforced?
   - Did they respect hero interactions?

5. **Patience vs Impatience**
   - Did they throw a lead by forcing unnecessary fights?
   - Did they damage control properly after lost fights?

6. **Positioning Quality**
   - Were they at correct range for their hero type?
   - Did supports position to save, not to fight?

7. **Build Coherence**
   - Did items match the playstyle they were executing?
   - Were there obvious contradictions?

8. **Decision Timing**
   - Did they make active decisions at key moments?
   - Or did they autopilot through critical junctures?

## Quick Reference Checklist

### Every Game
- [ ] Pre-game: Assess skill importance vs enemy lineup
- [ ] Early game: Check timer constantly (every 30-60 seconds)
- [ ] Laning: Don't leave with two range creeps
- [ ] Post-laning: Identify who is point of contact
- [ ] Mid game: Mid lane = decision point for map half
- [ ] Fights: Position based on point of contact role
- [ ] Losing: Damage control, don't compound mistakes

### Red Flags (Signs of Autopilot)
- Missing stacks at XX:00
- Running past spawning camps
- Dying with TP up
- Fighting without key spells
- Items that don't match playstyle
- Same positioning regardless of draft

## The Meta-Lesson

> "It's not about what decisions to make. It's about WHEN to make decisions."

The difference between good and great players isn't knowledge - it's consistently applying that knowledge at the right moments. These frameworks exist to create "decision triggers" - moments that tell you: STOP. THINK. DECIDE.
