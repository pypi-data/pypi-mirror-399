# MCP Dota 2 Match Analysis Server

??? info "AI Summary"

    MCP server for Dota 2 match analysis. **Install from PyPI** (`uv add mcp-replay-dota2`) or **DockerHub** (`docker pull dbcjuanma/mcp_replay_dota2`). **Tools** (LLM calls these): `get_match_heroes`, `get_match_players`, `get_hero_deaths`, `get_combat_log`, `get_fight_combat_log`, `get_item_purchases`, `get_objective_kills`, `get_match_timeline`, `get_stats_at_minute`, `get_courier_kills`, plus pro scene tools. **Game State Tools**: `list_fights`, `get_teamfights`, `get_fight`, `get_lane_summary`, `get_cs_at_minute`, `get_snapshot_at_time`, `get_farming_pattern`. **Resources** (static context): `dota2://heroes/all`, `dota2://map`, `dota2://pro/players`, `dota2://pro/teams`. Many tools are **parallel-safe** for efficient multi-point analysis. Connects to Claude Desktop, Claude Code, LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, or direct API integration.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives LLMs the ability to analyze Dota 2 matches by parsing replay files and querying the OpenDota API.

## Coaching Philosophy

This server includes **built-in coaching instructions** that guide LLM responses to provide meaningful analysis, not just raw data dumps:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify repetitive death patterns (support positioning, smoke ganks, vision-related deaths)
- **Objective Analysis**: Link tower kills to hero rotations (mid with rune, supports via portal, defender TPs)
- **Economy Tracking**: Explain networth swings in context of teamfights and objectives taken
- **Actionable Advice**: Every analysis ends with specific, actionable coaching points

The LLM is instructed to analyze the "why" behind the data, connecting statistics to game-changing decisions.

## What This Does

This server exposes **tools** and **resources** that an LLM can call to answer questions about Dota 2 matches:

- "Why did we lose the teamfight at 25 minutes?"
- "How did the enemy Anti-Mage get such a fast Battle Fury?"
- "When did Roshan die and who took the Aegis?"
- "Show me what happened when I died at minute 12"

The LLM reads the replay data and provides analysis based on actual game events, not guesswork.

   LLM synthesizes response: "The fight was lost because..."
```

**Resources** = Static data the LLM can reference (hero list, map positions)
**Tools** = Functions the LLM can call with parameters (get deaths, get combat log)

## Quick Start

### Option A: PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
uv add mcp-replay-dota2
uv run mcp-replay-dota2
```

### Option B: Docker

```bash
docker pull dbcjuanma/mcp_replay_dota2
docker run -p 8081:8081 dbcjuanma/mcp_replay_dota2 --transport sse
```

Connect to `http://localhost:8081/sse`. See [Docker Guide](getting-started/docker.md) for details.

### Option C: From Source (Contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeepBlueCoding/mcp-replay-dota2.git
cd mcp-replay-dota2
uv sync
uv run python dota_match_mcp_server.py
```

### 2. Connect to Your LLM

See [Integrations](integrations/index.md) for setup with:

- Claude Desktop
- Claude Code CLI
- OpenAI + LangChain
- Custom Python clients

### 3. Ask Questions

Once connected, just ask naturally:

> "Analyze match 8461956309. Why did Radiant lose?"

The LLM will automatically call the appropriate tools and synthesize an analysis.
