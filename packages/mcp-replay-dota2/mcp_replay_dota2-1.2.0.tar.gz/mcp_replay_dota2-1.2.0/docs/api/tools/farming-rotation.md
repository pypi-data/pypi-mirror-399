# Farming & Rotation Tools

High-level analysis tools that aggregate data from multiple sources to answer complex gameplay questions.

## get_farming_pattern

Analyze a hero's farming pattern - creep kills, camp rotations, and map movement.

This is THE tool for questions about "farming pattern", "how did X farm", "when did they start jungling", or "show me the farming movement minute by minute".

```python
get_farming_pattern(
    match_id=8461956309,
    hero="antimage",
    start_minute=0,
    end_minute=15
)
```

**Returns:**

**Key Fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `camp_sequence` | Ordered list of camps cleared each minute with position for path visualization |
| `camp_sequence[].position_x/y` | Coordinates where camp was cleared (for map visualization) |
| `camp_sequence[].creeps_killed` | Number of creeps killed in this camp |
| `wave_clears` | Grouped lane creep kills (creeps killed within 5s window) |
| `wave_clears[].position_x/y` | Coordinates where wave was cleared (for path visualization) |
| `multi_camp_clears` | Detects when hero farms 2+ camps simultaneously (stacked/adjacent camps) |
| `summary.multi_camp_clears` | Total count of multi-camp clear events |

**Multi-Camp Detection:**

Detects heroes like Medusa or Luna farming stacked or adjacent camps with AoE abilities. A multi-camp clear is recorded when creeps from 2+ different camp types are killed within 3 seconds.

**Example Questions This Tool Answers:**

- "What was Terrorblade's farming pattern in the first 10 minutes?"
- "When did Anti-Mage start jungling?"
- "Which camps did Luna clear between minutes 5-15?"
- "How did the carry move across the map while farming?"
- "Did Medusa farm stacked camps? How efficiently?"

## get_rotation_analysis

Analyze hero rotations - movement patterns between lanes, rune correlations, and outcomes.

This is THE tool for questions about rotations, ganks, mid rotations after rune pickups, or support movements between lanes.

```python
get_rotation_analysis(
    match_id=8461956309,
    start_minute=0,
    end_minute=20
)
```

**Returns:**

}
```

**Key Features:**

- **Rotation Detection**: Tracks when heroes leave their assigned lane and go to another lane
- **Rune Correlation**: Links power rune pickups (within 60s) to subsequent rotations
- **Fight Outcome**: Determines if rotation resulted in kill, death, trade, or no engagement
- **Fight Linking**: Provides `fight_id` - use `get_fight(fight_id)` for detailed combat log
- **Wisdom Rune Fights**: Detects contested wisdom rune spawns with deaths nearby

**Outcome Types:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `kill` | Rotating hero got a kill without dying |
| `died` | Rotating hero died without getting a kill |
| `traded` | Rotating hero got a kill but also died |
| `fight` | Rotation led to a fight but no kills by/on rotating hero |
| `no_engagement` | No deaths occurred within 60s of rotation |

**Example Questions This Tool Answers:**

- "How many rotations did the mid player make after power runes?"
- "Which rotations resulted in kills vs deaths?"
- "Were there any fights at wisdom rune spawns?"
- "Who was the most active rotator in the early game?"
- "Did the mid rotate after the 6-minute rune?"
