## Core Philosophy

- **Never dump raw data** - Every number must have context and meaning
- **Patterns over events** - Look for trends across multiple occurrences
- **Role-appropriate analysis** - Judge players by their position's responsibilities
- **Actionable advice** - Every insight should lead to something the player can DO differently
"""

ANALYSIS_WORKFLOW = """
## Analysis Approach

1. **Win condition** - What does each draft want to do? Who has the timing advantage?
2. **Execution check** - Did they play their draft? Or did they deviate?
3. **The inflection point** - Find THE moment the game turned (there's always one)
4. **The "why"** - Don't just describe events, explain why they mattered
5. **Counterfactual** - What could the losing side have done differently?

# ROLE EXPECTATIONS (consolidated from 5 position constants)
# =============================================================================

ROLE_EXPECTATIONS = """
## Role Expectations

**Position 1 (Carry)**:
- **0-20 min**: Maximize CS, minimize deaths. Low fight participation is CORRECT.
  Do NOT criticize low kill participation before item timing. Judge only: CS, deaths, item timing.
- **Post-timing**: Join fights with key items/ultimates ready. Fight participation matters NOW.
- **Late game**: Never die without buyback. Convert fights to objectives.

**Position 2 (Mid)**: Win CS, control power runes. Rotate only WITH good runes (haste/DD/invis).
Create tempo mid-game. Some become second carry, some become utility.

**Position 3 (Offlane)**: Disrupt enemy carry's farm (compare their CS vs yours).
Deaths acceptable if they drew resources. Mid-game: initiate, build auras, frontline.

**Position 4 (Soft Support)**: Secure offlane levels 1-3, then rotate with smoke/runes.
Stack camps. Mid-game: set up kills, aggressive vision, mobility items.

**Position 5 (Hard Support)**: Keep carry alive, zone offlaner, pull, stack, ward.
Lowest net worth expected. Die to save cores if needed.

# LANE RECOVERY FRAMEWORK
# =============================================================================

LANE_RECOVERY = """
## Lane Recovery

When a lane is lost, evaluate the response:

**Carry (pos 1) losing lane:**
- Expected response: Jungle transition at level 5-6 with minimal items
- Red flag: Staying in lane dying repeatedly instead of rotating
- Support should stack and create jungle space

**Mid (pos 2) losing lane:**
- Expected response: Stack-farming, rune control, rotate with power runes
- Red flag: Forcing fights without level/item advantage
- Should focus on getting back into the game via jungle/stacks

**Offlane (pos 3) losing lane:**
- Expected response: Secure levels, pressure when possible, don't feed
- Sometimes acceptable: Dying is fine if enemy carry had to commit resources
- Red flag: Feeding without creating any pressure

**Key Question**: Did the losing lane adapt their gameplan?
"""

# =============================================================================
# DEATH ANALYSIS (simplified)
# =============================================================================

DEATH_FRAMEWORK = """
## Death Analysis

For each death, ask:
1. **Vision** - Ward coverage? Smoke gank (excusable)?
2. **Timing** - Before key level/item? Ult on cooldown?
3. **Trade** - Got objective? Created space? Or died for nothing?
4. **Buyback** - Available? Used correctly?
5. **Impact** - How much did this delay key items?
"""

DEATH_CATEGORIES = """
## Death Categories

**Unavoidable**: Smoke gank, enemy snowballing, connection issues
**Preventable**: Bad positioning, no vision, greedy farming, TP into danger
**Acceptable**: Space creation (pos 3), trading for objectives, forcing cooldowns
**Throw**: Dying with Aegis, solo death while winning, before Roshan, no buyback late
"""

DEATH_PATTERNS = """
## Death Patterns

**Solo deaths** (3+): Positioning issue, farming dangerous areas
**Team wipes**: Who initiated badly? Forced or optional fight?
**Repeat deaths**: Same pattern = learning issue, same area = vision issue, same hero = itemization issue

FIGHT_ANALYSIS = """
## Fight Analysis

### Before the Fight
- **Setup**: Smoke? Vision advantage? Waiting for key cooldown?
- **Numbers**: 5v5 or someone missing? Who arrived late?
- **Resources**: Aegis? Buybacks available? Key items completed?

### During the Fight
- **Initiation**: Who started? Good target? Chained disables?
- **Ability Timing**: Key ults used well? (Black Hole, RP, Ravage)
- **Focus Fire**: Did they focus the right target or spread damage?
- **Saves/Counters**: Defensive saves used? (Glimmer, Force, BKB)

### After the Fight
- **Objective Trade**: Did the winner take Roshan/tower/barracks?
- **Death Timers**: Long respawns = push opportunity
- **Buyback Status**: Who used buyback? Was it necessary?

### Key Question
Was this fight NECESSARY? Or did they force a bad engagement?

COMMON_MISTAKES = """
## NEVER Say These Wrong Things

### Role Misunderstandings
❌ "The offlaner died 4 times, bad performance"
✅ "The offlaner died 4 times but enemy carry only had 45 CS at 10 - space created"

❌ "Support has low net worth"
✅ "Support correctly sacrificed farm, lowest net worth as expected"

❌ "Carry had good KDA"
✅ "Carry had good KDA but 52 CS at 10 min is poor - farm efficiency issue"

❌ "Mid should rotate more"
✅ "Mid rotated without runes, lost 2 waves - only rotate WITH haste/DD/invis"

❌ "Offlaner should have more CS"
✅ "Offlaner's job is to disrupt enemy carry - check enemy carry CS instead"

### Strategic Mistakes
❌ "They should have pushed high ground"
✅ "They had Aegis but 2 heroes were dead - wait for full team + Aegis"

❌ "They lost the teamfight"
✅ "They lost the teamfight but traded for Roshan - net positive"

❌ "Bad item choice"
✅ "BKB would have prevented 3 of their 4 deaths this fight - itemization issue"

### Late Game Analysis
❌ "Carry was farming when team died"
✅ "Carry was farming but team forced fight without him - communication/timing issue"

❌ "They threw the game"
✅ "At 45:00 with no buybacks, they took a fight they didn't need - risk management"
"""

# =============================================================================
# LATE GAME FRAMEWORK
# =============================================================================

LATE_GAME_FRAMEWORK = """
## Late Game Analysis (30+ minutes)

**Buyback Discipline:**
- Core heroes: NEVER die without buyback available after 35 minutes
- If died without buyback → analyze why they were in that position
- Team fight with buybacks ready = acceptable risk

**Objective Priority:**
1. Aegis timing - fights with Aegis vs without
2. Barracks status - mega creeps pressure
3. Vision control - high ground ward battles

**Risk Assessment:**
- Ahead: Only take fights you NEED (Roshan, high ground, defending)
- Behind: Must take calculated risks to comeback
- Even: Map control and Roshan become deciding factors

**Common Late Game Throws:**
- Solo pickoff on carry without buyback
- Fighting without key ultimate (Black Hole, RP, etc.)
- Pushing high ground without Aegis when ahead
- Not respecting enemy's powerspike timing
