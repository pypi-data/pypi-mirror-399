# RolyPoly

RolyPoly is an RNA virus analysis toolkit, meant to be a "swiss-army knife" for RNA virus discovery and characterization by including a variety of commands, wrappers, parsers, automations, and some "quality of life" features for any many of a virus investigation process (from raw read processing to genome annotation). While it includes an "end-2-end" command that employs an entire pipeline, the main goals of rolypoly are:
- Help non-computational researchers take a deep dive into their data without compromising on using tools that are non-techie friendly.  
- Help (software) developers of virus analysis pipeline "plug" holes missing from their framework, by using specific RolyPoly commands to add features to their existing code base.

## WIP - NOTE
RolyPoly is an open, still in progress project - I aim to summrise the main functionality into a manuscript by the end of 2025, or early 2026. Pull requests and contributions are welcome and will be considered (see)

## Docs
For more detailed information, please refer to the [docs](https://pages.jgi.doe.gov/rolypoly/docs/). While it isn't updated often, it should still be helpful. Most commands support a `--help` flag and that tends to be the most up date.

## Installation

### Quick and Easy - One Conda/Mamba Environment
**Recommended for most users** who want a "just works" solution and primarily intend to use rolypoly as a CLI tool in an independent environment.

We hope to have rolypoly available from bioconda in the near future.  
In the meantime, it can be installed with the [`quick_setup.sh`](https://code.jgi.doe.gov/rolypoly/rolypoly/-/raw/main/src/setup/quick_setup.sh) script which which will also fetch the pre-generated data rolypoly will require.

```bash
curl -O https://code.jgi.doe.gov/rolypoly/rolypoly/-/raw/main/src/setup/quick_setup.sh && \
bash quick_setup.sh 
```

#### Quick Setup - Additional Options
You can specify custom paths for the code, databases, and conda environment location:
```bash
bash quick_setup.sh /path/to/conda/env /path/to/install/rolypoly_code /path/to/store/databases /path/to/logfile
```
By default if no positional arguments are supplied, rolypoly is installed into the session current folder (path the quick_setup.sh is called from):   
- database in `./rolypoly/data/`  
- code in `./rolypoly/code/ `  
- conda enviroment in `./rolypoly/env/`  
- log file in `./RolyPoly_quick_setup.log`   



### Modular / Dev - Command-Specific Pixi Environments
**For software developers** looking to try or make use of specific rolypoly features with minimal risk of dependency conflicts. This approach allows you to install only the tools you need for specific functionality.

```bash
# Install pixi first (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://code.jgi.doe.gov/rolypoly/rolypoly.git
cd rolypoly

# Install for specific functionality (examples):
pixi install -e reads-only        # Just read processing tools
pixi install -e assembly-only     # Just assembly tools  
pixi install -e basic-analysis    # Reads + assembly + identification
pixi install -e complete          # All tools (equivalent to legacy install)

# Run commands in the appropriate environment
pixi run -e reads-only rolypoly filter-reads --help
# or load the environment
pixi shell -e reads-only
rolypoly filter-reads --help
```  
For detailed modular installation options, see the [installation documentation](https://pages.jgi.doe.gov/rolypoly/docs/installation).

## Usage
RolyPoly is a command-line tool with subcommands grouped by analysis stage. For a detailed help (in terminal), use `rolypoly --help` or `rolypoly <group> --help`. For more specific help, see the [docs](https://pages.jgi.doe.gov/rolypoly/docs/commands/index.md).

```bash
rolypoly [OPTIONS] <GROUP> <COMMAND> [ARGS]...
```

## Dependencies

**📦 Modular Installation Available**: RolyPoly supports both quick setup (one environment for all tools) and modular installation (command-specific environments). The modular approach is particularly useful for software developers who want to integrate specific rolypoly features with minimal dependency conflicts. See the [installation documentation](./docs/docs/mkdocs_docs/installation.md) for details.

Not all 3rd party software is used by all the different commands. RolyPoly includes a "citation reminder" that will try to list all the external software used by a command. The "reminded citations" are pretty printed to console (stdout) but are also written to a logfile. The bibtex file rolypoly uses for this is included in the codebase.

## Motivation
There are many good virus analysis software out there*. Many of them are custom made for specific virus groups, some are generalists, but most of them require complete control over the analysis process (so one or two point of entry for data). Apart from the input, these pipelines vary in their implementation (laguange, workflow magnement system (snakemake, nextflow...), dependecies), methodologies (tool choice for similar step like assembler), goals (e.g. specific pathogen analysis vs whole  virome analysis). These are other differences effect the design process and the tooling choices (such as selecting a fast nucleic based sequence search method limited to high identity, over a slow but more senstive profile or structure (amino) based search method). This has created some "lock in" (IMO), and I have found myself asked by people "what do you recomend for xyz" or "which pipeline should I use". Most people have limited time to invest in custom analysis pipeline design and so end up opting for an existing, off-the-shelve option, potentially compromising or having to align their goals with what the given software offers (if they they are already aligned - great!).
