"""FraiseQL Types Package.

Provides decorators and common GraphQL types for FraiseQL.

Exports:
- `type`: Decorator to mark a dataclass as a GraphQL object type.
- `input`: Decorator to mark a dataclass as a GraphQL input type.
- `fraise_type` and `fraise_input`: Internal decorator implementations to avoid
  shadowing Python builtins.

Usage:

    from fraiseql.types import type, input

    @type
    class User:
        id: int
        name: str

    @input
    class CreateUserInput:
        name: str
