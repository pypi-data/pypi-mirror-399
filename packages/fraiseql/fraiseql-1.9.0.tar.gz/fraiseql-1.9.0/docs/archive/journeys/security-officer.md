## Troubleshooting

### Common Security Assessment Questions

**Q: How does FraiseQL compare to Apollo Federation for security?**
A: FraiseQL has tighter security integration with PostgreSQL (native RLS, audit trails). Apollo requires custom implementation for equivalent controls.

**Q: Can we use our existing HSM for key management?**
A: Yes, via HashiCorp Vault integration. Vault can integrate with HSMs (PKCS#11).

**Q: What's the audit log retention maximum?**
A: No hard limit. Configure based on compliance requirements (7 years typical for PCI-DSS). PostgreSQL supports archival to object storage.

**Q: Can we disable the Rust pipeline for security review simplicity?**
A: Yes, set `FRAISEQL_RUST_DISABLED=1`. Python-only mode available (with performance trade-off).

**Q: How do we verify no backdoors in dependencies?**
A: SBOM includes complete dependency tree. Use `grype` or `syft` to scan for known vulnerabilities. Reproducible builds ensure integrity.

**Q: What's the encryption key rotation procedure?**
A: KMS providers handle rotation automatically. FraiseQL re-encrypts data on read with new key (transparent to application).

## Summary

You now have:
- ✅ Complete compliance framework mapping
- ✅ Security profile recommendation
- ✅ Risk assessment documentation
- ✅ SLSA provenance verification procedure
