---

## Performance Claims & Methodology

### Claim: "2-4x faster than traditional GraphQL frameworks"

**What this means**: FraiseQL is 2-4x faster than frameworks like Strawberry, Hasura, or PostGraphile for typical workloads, with end-to-end optimizations including APQ caching, field projection, and exclusive Rust pipeline transformation.

**Methodology**:
- **Baseline comparison**: Measured against Strawberry GraphQL (Python ORM) and Hasura (PostgreSQL GraphQL)
- **Test queries**: Simple user lookup, nested user+posts, filtered searches
- **Dataset**: 10k-100k records in PostgreSQL 15
- **Hardware**: Standard cloud instances (4 CPU, 8GB RAM)
- **Measurement**: End-to-end response time including database queries

**Realistic expectations**:
- **Simple queries** (single table): 2-3x faster
- **Complex queries** (joins, aggregations): 3-4x faster
- **Cached queries**: 4-10x faster (due to APQ optimization)
- **All queries**: Use exclusive Rust pipeline (PostgreSQL → Rust → HTTP)

**When this matters**: High-throughput APIs (>100 req/sec) where small latency improvements compound.

---

### Claim: "Sub-millisecond cached responses (0.5-2ms)"

**What this means**: Cached GraphQL queries return in 0.5-2ms when all optimization layers are active.

**Methodology**:
- **APQ caching**: SHA-256 hash lookup with PostgreSQL storage backend
- **Rust pipeline**: Direct database JSONB → Rust transformation → HTTP response (no Python string operations)
- **Field projection**: Optional filtering of requested GraphQL fields
- **Measurement**: Time from GraphQL request to HTTP response (excluding network latency)

**Realistic expectations**:
- **Cache hit**: 0.5-2ms (Rust pipeline + APQ)
- **Cache miss**: 5-25ms (includes database query)
- **Cache hit rate**: 85-95% in production applications

**Conditions**:
- PostgreSQL 15+ with proper indexing
- APQ storage backend configured (PostgreSQL recommended)
- Query complexity score < 100
- Response size < 50KB
- Exclusive Rust pipeline active (automatic in v1.0.0+)

---

### Claim: "85-95% cache hit rates in production applications"

**What this means**: Well-designed applications achieve 85-95% APQ cache hit rates with the exclusive Rust pipeline.

**Methodology**:
- **Client configuration**: Apollo Client with persisted queries enabled
- **Query patterns**: Stable query structure (no dynamic field selection)
- **Cache TTL**: 1-24 hours depending on data freshness requirements
- **Measurement**: Cache hits / (cache hits + cache misses) over 24-hour period

**Realistic expectations**:
- **Stable APIs**: 95%+ hit rate
- **Dynamic queries**: 80-90% hit rate
- **Admin interfaces**: 70-85% hit rate (more unique queries)

**Factors affecting hit rate**:
- Query stability (fewer unique queries = higher hit rate)
- Client-side query deduplication
- Cache TTL settings
- Query complexity (simple queries cache better)
- Rust pipeline compatibility (automatic)

---

### Claim: "0.05-0.5ms table view responses"

**What this means**: Table views (`tv_*`) provide instant responses for complex queries, processed through the exclusive Rust pipeline.

**Methodology**:
- **Table views**: Denormalized tables with pre-computed data
- **Comparison**: Traditional JOIN queries vs table view lookups
- **Dataset**: 10k users with 50k posts (average 5 posts/user)
- **Measurement**: Database query time only (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)

**Realistic expectations**:
- **Table view lookup**: 0.05-0.5ms
- **Traditional JOIN**: 5-50ms (depends on data size)
- **Speedup**: 10-100x faster for complex nested queries
- **Rust pipeline**: Automatic camelCase transformation and __typename injection

**When this applies**:
- Read-heavy workloads with stable data relationships
- Queries with fixed nesting patterns
- Applications where data freshness is less critical than speed

## Query Complexity Impact

### Complexity Scoring

FraiseQL calculates query complexity to prevent expensive operations:

```python
# Complexity calculation
complexity = field_count + (list_size * nested_fields) + multipliers

# Example multipliers
field_multipliers = {
    "search": 5,      # Text search operations
    "aggregate": 10,  # COUNT, SUM, AVG operations
    "sort": 2,        # ORDER BY clauses
}
```

### Performance by Complexity

| Complexity Score | Response Time | Use Case | Optimization Priority |
|------------------|---------------|----------|----------------------|
| 1-50 | 0.5-2ms | Simple lookups | Low |
| 51-200 | 2-10ms | Nested data | Medium |
| 201-500 | 10-50ms | Complex aggregations | High |
| 501-1000 | 50-200ms | Heavy computations | Critical |
| 1000+ | 200ms+ | Rejected | N/A |

### Optimization Strategies by Complexity

**Low Complexity (1-50)**:
- Focus on caching (APQ + result caching)
- Field projection for reduced data transfer
- Table views for instant responses

**Medium Complexity (51-200)**:
- Table views for nested relationships
- Database indexing optimization
- Query result caching
- Field projection optimization

**High Complexity (201-500)**:
- Materialized views for aggregations
- Background computation
- Result caching with short TTL
- Minimize JSONB size in table views

## CASCADE Selection Optimization

### Overview

CASCADE data can add significant payload size to mutation responses. Use selective requesting to optimize performance.

### Payload Size Comparison

| Selection | Typical Size | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| No CASCADE | 200-500 bytes | Display-only mutations |
| Metadata only | 300-600 bytes | Need count info only |
| Invalidations only | 400-800 bytes | Cache clearing only |
| Full CASCADE | 1,500-5,000 bytes | Complete cache sync |

### Best Practices

**1. Request Only What You Need**
```graphql
# ❌ Bad: Request everything when you only need count
cascade {
  updated { __typename id operation entity }
  deleted { __typename id }
  invalidations { queryName strategy scope }
  metadata { timestamp affectedCount }
}

# ✅ Good: Request only metadata
cascade {
  metadata { affectedCount }
}
```

**2. Use Conditional CASCADE with Directives**
```graphql
mutation CreatePost($input: CreatePostInput!, $needCascade: Boolean!) {
  createPost(input: $input) {
    ... on CreatePostSuccess {
      post { id title }
      cascade @include(if: $needCascade) {
        updated { __typename id entity }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Profile Your Queries**

Use GraphQL query complexity analysis to understand CASCADE impact:

```javascript
// Measure response size
const response = await client.mutate({ mutation: CREATE_POST });
console.log('Response size:', JSON.stringify(response).length);

// Compare with and without CASCADE
```

**4. Mobile-Specific Optimizations**

For mobile clients, avoid CASCADE on:
- Background sync operations
- Bulk operations
- Low-priority mutations

Request CASCADE only on user-initiated, UI-critical mutations.

### Performance Monitoring

Track CASCADE payload sizes in production:

```python
from prometheus_client import Histogram

cascade_payload_size = Histogram(
    'graphql_cascade_payload_bytes',
    'CASCADE payload size in bytes',
    buckets=[100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000]
)
```

Alert on large payloads:

```yaml
- alert: LargeCascadePayloads
  expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, cascade_payload_bytes) > 10000
  for: 5m
```
