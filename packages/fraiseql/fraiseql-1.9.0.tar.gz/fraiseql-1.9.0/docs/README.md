## Core Features

FraiseQL provides everything you need for modern APIs:

### pgvector Integration

Native PostgreSQL vector search for semantic search and RAG applications.

- Type-safe GraphQL integration with vector operators
- Query semantically similar documents with vector similarity
- **[Learn more →](features/pgvector/)**

### GraphQL Cascade

Automatic, intelligent cache invalidation that works with your data relationships.

- Zero manual cache management
- Intelligent invalidation based on SQL relationships
- **[Learn more →](features/graphql-cascade/)** | **[Best Practices →](guides/cascade-best-practices/)**

### LangChain Integration

Build AI-powered applications with document ingestion and semantic search.

- Production-ready patterns for RAG applications
- Seamless document embedding and vector storage
- **[Learn more →](guides/langchain-integration/)**

### LLM Integration

Use LLMs directly in your GraphQL resolvers.

- Type-safe LLM calling from Python
- Built-in streaming and error handling
- **[Learn more →](features/ai-native/)**
