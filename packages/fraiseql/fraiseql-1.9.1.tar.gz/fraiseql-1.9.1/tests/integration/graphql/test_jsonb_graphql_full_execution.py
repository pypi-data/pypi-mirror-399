"""Tests for JSONB entities through full GraphQL execution stack.

This test suite validates that JSONB entities work correctly when accessed
through GraphQL resolvers with typed return values, not just direct repository access.

This reproduces the PrintOptim team's reported issue where:
- Direct repository calls work
- GraphQL queries with typed resolvers fail with RustResponseBytes errors
