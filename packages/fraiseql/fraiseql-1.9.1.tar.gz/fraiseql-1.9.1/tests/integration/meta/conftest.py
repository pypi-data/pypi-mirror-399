"""Fixtures for meta-integration tests.

Meta-tests validate that ALL components of a category work through the
complete pipeline. They auto-enumerate components and test each one.

NOTE: meta_test_pool and meta_test_schema are now defined in parent
conftest.py (tests/integration/conftest.py) for sharing across all
integration tests.
"""

# Meta-specific fixtures can be added here
# Shared fixtures (meta_test_pool, meta_test_schema) are in parent conftest.py
