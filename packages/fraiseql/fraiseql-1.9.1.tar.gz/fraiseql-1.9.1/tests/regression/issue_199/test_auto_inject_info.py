"""Regression test for Issue #199: Auto-inject info parameter for GraphQL field selection.

This test validates that the @fraiseql.query decorator automatically injects the 'info'
parameter into the GraphQL context, enabling field selection by default without requiring
developers to manually pass info=info to db.find() and db.find_one() calls.

Problem:
    Forgetting to pass info=info causes:
    - 60-80% larger payloads (all columns vs selected fields)
    - 7-10x slower serialization (no Rust zero-copy projection)
    - Silent performance degradation (no errors)

Solution:
    Auto-inject info into context['graphql_info'] via @fraiseql.query decorator.
    Repository methods (db.find, db.find_one) extract info from context automatically.

Issue: https://github.com/fraiseql/fraiseql/issues/199
