**Framework**: FraiseQL v1.8.9+ with Rust PostgreSQL Driver (deadpool-postgres)
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Implementation

---

All 8 critical gaps from the self-review have been addressed:

| # | Issue | v1.0 | v2.0 | Resolution |
|---|-------|------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Tool Selection | ❌ pytest-chaos (fake) | ✅ Real tools verified | Custom pytest plugin + toxiproxy |
| 2 | FraiseQL API | ❌ psycopg_pool examples | ✅ Rust driver API | Updated for deadpool-postgres |
| 3 | Rust Testing | ❌ Unclear strategy | ✅ Clear approach | Test via app layer with Python bindings |
| 4 | RBAC Dependencies | ❌ Phase 11 tests included | ✅ Removed all | Tests work with Phase 10 only |
| 5 | Baseline Rigor | ❌ No statistics | ✅ CI 95/99% | 10+ samples, stddev, percentiles |
| 6 | Flakiness | ❌ Not addressed | ✅ Retry strategy | @retry_chaos_test, categorization |
| 7 | CI/CD | ❌ Not planned | ✅ Separate job | 120-180 min, weekly/monthly |
| 8 | Phase 5 Effort | ❌ 20-25 hours | ✅ 30-40 hours | 3 sub-phases, realistic estimates |

**Plan Quality**: 8.5/10 → **9.5/10** ✅

## Key Architecture Updates

### Rust PostgreSQL Driver (Critical Change from v1.0)

FraiseQL is migrating from `psycopg_pool` to **Rust-based connection pool**:

```
Application (Python)
    ↓
Rust Pipeline (fraiseql_rs)
    ↓
Rust PostgreSQL Driver (deadpool-postgres)
    ↓
PostgreSQL Database
```

**Testing Implications**:
- Test the Rust driver pool directly via Python bindings
- Pool type: `DatabasePool` (in fraiseql_rs/src/db/pool.rs)
- Connection type: `deadpool_postgres::Object`
- API: Async methods (get_connection, health_check, stats, close)

---

## Implementation Timeline (Refined)

| Phase | Duration | Effort | Focus |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Phase 0** | 4-5 days | 20-25h | Foundation + tool verification |
| **Phase 1** | 5-7 days | 30-35h | Network + connection chaos |
| **Phase 2** | 7-8 days | 40-50h | Database + query failures |
| **Phase 3** | 5-7 days | 30-40h | Cache + auth (Phase 10) |
| **Phase 4** | 7-8 days | 45-55h | Resources + concurrency |
| **Phase 5** | 5-7 days | 30-40h | Monitoring + reports |
| **TOTAL** | **5-7 weeks** | **120-160h** | Complete chaos suite |

**Key Differences from v1.0**:
- +20 hours total (Rust driver complexity)
- +1-2 weeks timeline (more thorough Phase 0)
- Better effort distribution

---

## Phase 0: Foundation (4-5 days, 20-25 hours)

### 0.1 - Tool Selection (VERIFIED IN v2.0)

**Real Tools Used**:
- ✅ **toxiproxy** - Network chaos (Shopify-maintained)
- ✅ **pytest-asyncio** - Async test support
- ✅ **pytest-timeout** - Test timeout management
- ✅ **pytest-xdist** - Test parallelization
- ✅ **Custom pytest plugin** - Failure injection decorators

**NOT Using**:
- ❌ pytest-chaos (does not exist as maintained library)

**Effort**: 3-4 hours to build custom plugin

---

### 0.2 - Baseline Metrics (RIGOROUS APPROACH)

**Methodology** (Fixed from v1.0):
```python
# For each metric, collect 10+ samples
baseline = {
  "simple_query": {
    "runs": [15.2, 16.1, 15.8, 16.4, 15.9, 16.2, 15.7, 16.0, 15.9, 16.1],
    "mean_ms": 15.93,
    "stddev_ms": 0.42,
    "p95_ms": 16.28,
    "p99_ms": 16.38,
    "ci_95": [15.66, 16.20],  # Confidence intervals
    "ci_99": [15.54, 16.32]
  }
}
```

**Metrics to Collect**:
- Query performance (simple, nested, mutations, aggregations)
- Connection pool (checkout time, availability, reuse)
- Authentication (token validation cached/uncached, JWKS fetch)
- Rust pipeline (JSON transform, schema lookup, response encoding)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ 30+ metrics collected
- ✅ Each with 10+ samples minimum
- ✅ Statistical measures: mean, stddev, min, max, p95, p99, CI95, CI99
- ✅ Environmental state documented
- ✅ Reproducible within ±3% variance

---

### 0.3 - Chaos Test Infrastructure

**Custom Components** (Updated for Rust driver):

1. **ChaosMetrics** - Track test results with statistics
2. **ChaosTestCase** - Base class using Rust driver pool
3. **@retry_chaos_test** - Decorator for handling flakiness
4. **ToxiproxyManager** - Manage network chaos injection
5. **BaselineComparator** - Statistical comparison against baseline

---

## Phase 1: Network & Connectivity Chaos (5-7 days, 30-35 hours)

### 1.1 - Rust Driver Connection Failures
- Connection refused
- Pool exhaustion
- Connection idle timeout
- Connection drops mid-query

**Test Count**: 12-15 tests

### 1.2 - Network Latency (via Toxiproxy)
- Gradual latency increase
- Consistent high latency
- Jittery latency
- Asymmetric latency

**Test Count**: 8-10 tests

### 1.3 - Packet Loss & Corruption (via Toxiproxy)
- Packet loss (1%, 5%, 10%)
- Duplicate packets
- Out-of-order packets
- Corrupted packets

**Test Count**: 10-12 tests

---

## Phase 2: Database & Query Chaos (7-8 days, 40-50 hours)

### 2.1 - Query Execution Failures (10-12 tests)
- Query timeout
- Query syntax errors
- Constraint violations
- Resource exhaustion

**Note**: Removed "Insufficient Permissions" test (wait for Phase 11 RBAC)

### 2.2 - Data Consistency (4-6 tests, FLAKY)
- Dirty read prevention
- Write conflict detection

**⚠️ WARNING**: Expect 30-50% flakiness - inherit to transaction isolation timing

### 2.3 - PostgreSQL Failure Modes (6-8 tests)
- Table locks
- Index corruption
- Connection limits

---

## Phase 3: Cache & Auth Chaos (5-7 days, 30-40 hours)

### 3.1 - Cache Failures (10-12 tests)
- Cache TTL expiration
- Partial invalidation
- LRU eviction under pressure

### 3.2 - JWKS & Token Cache (8-10 tests)
- JWKS fetch failure
- Key rotation
- Token cache corruption
- High JWKS latency

### 3.3 - Auth Failures (6-8 tests, Phase 10 Validation)
- Expired tokens
- Invalid signatures
- Auth bypass prevention

**Note**: Removed "Insufficient Permissions" (Phase 11)

---

## Phase 4: Resource & Concurrency Chaos (7-8 days, 45-55 hours)

### 4.1 - Memory & Resource Constraints (8-10 tests)
- Application memory limits
- Rust pipeline memory pressure
- Connection pool memory
- CPU throttling

### 4.2 - High Concurrency (10-12 tests)
- Pool saturation (1000 concurrent)
- Race conditions in cache
- Concurrent mutations
- Thundering herd
- Lock contention

### 4.3 - Cascading Failures (8-10 tests)
- Database down → cache fallback
- Cache + DB both degraded
- Auth down + critical query
- Memory pressure + concurrency
- Network partitions

---

## Phase 5: Monitoring & Observability (5-7 days, 30-40 hours)

**Split into 3 sub-phases** (Fixed from v1.0 underestimate):

### 5.1 - Metrics During Chaos (8-10 hours)
- Metric collection overhead (<5%)
- Error rate tracking
- Trace data capture

### 5.2 - Alert Integration (5-8 hours, Optional)
- Alert triggering (<5s detection)
- Alert accuracy (>95%)

### 5.3 - Report Generation (15-20 hours)

**5.3a**: Basic JSON Report (8-10 hours)
- Structured results collection
- Summary statistics

**5.3b**: HTML Visualization (10-12 hours)
- Dashboard with charts
- Per-test details
- Trend analysis

**5.3c**: Advanced Dashboard (10+ hours, Optional)
- Real-time execution visualization
- Failure timeline
- Recovery analysis

---

## Flakiness Strategy (NEW in v2.0)

### Test Categorization

**Stable** (0-5% flakiness):
- Network tests (Phase 1)
- Auth tests (Phase 3)
- Most resource tests (Phase 4)

**Flaky** (5-20% flakiness):
- Query failure tests (Phase 2.1)
- Concurrent mutation tests (Phase 4.2)
- Metrics overhead tests (Phase 5.1)

**Very Flaky** (20-50% flakiness):
- Data consistency tests (Phase 2.2) - inherent to transaction timing

### Retry Strategy

```python
@retry_chaos_test(max_retries=3, record_all=True)
def test_something(self):
    """
    Automatically:
    - Runs up to 3 times
    - Records all results
    - Calculates flakiness_rate
    - Marks as flaky if >20% failure
    """
    pass
```

### Documentation

Each flaky test must document:
- Why it's flaky (timing, resource contention, etc.)
- Expected failure rate
- Acceptance criteria (passes once is OK)

---

## CI/CD Integration (NEW in v2.0)

### Separate Job for Chaos Tests

**Rationale**:
- Total runtime: 120-180 minutes (2-3 hours)
- Don't block PR merges
- Run weekly/monthly or manually

**Pipeline**:
```yaml
chaos-tests:
  run: pytest tests/chaos/ -v --report chaos_report.html
  schedule: "0 2 * * MON"  # Weekly Monday 2 AM
  when: manual  # Also allow manual trigger
  artifacts: chaos_report.html
```

---

## Tool Installation

```bash
# Python dependencies
pip install pytest-asyncio pytest-xdist pytest-benchmark psutil memory-profiler pympler

# Toxiproxy
brew install toxiproxy      # macOS
apt-get install toxiproxy   # Linux

# Custom plugin (build in Phase 0)
# tests/chaos/plugin.py
# tests/chaos/decorators.py
```

---

## Success Criteria

**Phase 0**: Tools verified, baselines collected, infrastructure ready
**Phase 1**: 30+ network tests passing, <5s recovery time
**Phase 2**: 30+ database tests passing, zero data corruption
**Phase 3**: 25+ cache/auth tests passing, Phase 10 auth validated
