## 📊 Architecture Overview

FraiseQL uses a unified architecture with exclusive Rust pipeline execution for all queries.

| Component | Location | Status | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|--------|---------|
| **FraiseQL Framework** | Root level | ✅ Production | Complete GraphQL framework with Rust pipeline |
| **Rust Pipeline** | [`fraiseql_rs/`](../../fraiseql_rs/) | ✅ Core | Exclusive query execution engine (7-10x faster) |
| **Examples** | `examples/` | ✅ Reference | Production-ready application patterns |
| **Documentation** | [`docs/`](../../docs/) | ✅ Current | Comprehensive guides and tutorials |
