## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Assessment
1. Identify applicable regulations for your jurisdiction
2. Determine required security profile (STANDARD/REGULATED/RESTRICTED)
3. Review SBOM requirements

### Phase 2: Configuration
1. Enable security profile:
   ```python
   from fraiseql.security.profiles import SecurityProfile, ProfileEnforcer

   enforcer = ProfileEnforcer(profile=SecurityProfile.REGULATED)
   ```
2. Configure KMS provider (if required):
   ```python
   from fraiseql.security.kms import VaultKMSProvider, VaultConfig

   kms = VaultKMSProvider(VaultConfig(
       vault_addr="https://vault.example.com:8200",
       token=os.environ["VAULT_TOKEN"]
   ))
   ```

### Phase 3: SBOM Generation
1. Generate SBOM:
   ```bash
   fraiseql sbom generate --output fraiseql-1.0.0-sbom.json
   ```
2. Integrate into CI/CD (see `.github/workflows/sbom-generation.yml`)
3. Distribute SBOM to customers/auditors

### Phase 4: Continuous Compliance
1. Enable audit logging
2. Monitor security events
3. Update SBOM with each release
4. Conduct regular security assessments
