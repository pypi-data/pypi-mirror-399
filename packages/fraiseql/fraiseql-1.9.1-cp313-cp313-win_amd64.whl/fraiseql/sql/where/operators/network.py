"""Network/IP address specific operators.

This module contains the core fix for the IP filtering bug described in the guide.
The key insight is to use proper PostgreSQL inet casting instead of string comparison.

Basic comparison operators use the generic base builders. Network-specific operators
(in_subnet, is_private, is_public) are implemented directly as they have no generic equivalent.
