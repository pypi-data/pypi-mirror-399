  - All datetime references now use `timezone.utc` for broad compatibility

## [0.4.4] - 2025-01-17

### Fixed

- **Media Title Extraction** - Fixed initial state loading bug where empty title strings would fall back to username (queueby)

- Consistent use of `self.app._domain` for default domain in all handlers
- All 70 unit tests still passing

## [0.4.1] - 2025-12-12

### Changed

  - Inherits from `kryten.BaseMetricsServer` for shared HTTP infrastructure
  - Now exposes `/health` endpoint (JSON) in addition to `/metrics`
  - Custom metrics and health details in `_collect_custom_metrics()` and `_get_health_details()`
  - Reduced code duplication with shared library

### Added

- `/health` endpoint returns JSON with service status, database info, and session counts

### Technical Details

- Now requires kryten-py>=0.8.1
- MetricsServer now subclasses BaseMetricsServer from kryten-py

## [0.4.0] - 2025-06-16

### Changed

- **Lifecycle Integration** - Migrated to kryten-py 0.8.0's integrated lifecycle management
  - ServiceConfig now defined in config.json instead of code
  - Automatic startup/shutdown events via KrytenClient
  - Automatic heartbeat publishing (configurable interval)
  - Automatic discovery poll response
  - Removed ~50 lines of manual lifecycle code

### Added

  - `enable_heartbeat`: Enable heartbeat publishing (default: true)
  - `heartbeat_interval`: Heartbeat interval in seconds (default: 30)
  - `enable_discovery`: Respond to discovery polls (default: true)

### Fixed

- Fixed logger being used before initialization in main()

### Technical Details

- Now requires kryten-py>=0.8.0
- `_handle_robot_startup` now uses `self.client.lifecycle.publish_startup()`
- Lifecycle shutdown automatically handled by `client.disconnect()`
- Simplified stop() method

## [0.2.5] - 2025-12-09

### Changed

## [0.2.3] - 2025-12-05

### Added

  - 12 query endpoints: user stats, messages, activity, kudos, channel info, leaderboards, system health
  - Request/reply pattern on `userstats.query.{domain}.{query_type}` subjects
  - kryten-userstats owns and publishes its statistics data directly

### Changed
- **Separation of Duties** - Clear architectural boundary:
  - Consumes CyTube events via kryten-py (no direct NATS access for events)
  - Publishes statistics data via direct NATS connection (owns its data)
  - Two separate NATS connections with distinct responsibilities

### Technical Details
- Added `nats_publisher.py` with StatsPublisher class
- Dedicated NATS connection for query responses
- JSON request/reply protocol
- All query handlers async with error handling

## [0.2.2] - 2025-12-05

### Removed
- **NATS Query Endpoints** - Removed all query endpoints that accessed NATS directly
  - kryten-py does not expose NATS client and direct access violates architecture
  - Only HTTP Prometheus metrics server remains for data exposure

### Changed
- Simplified architecture to use only kryten-py's public API
- All statistics now exposed via HTTP metrics endpoint only (port 28282)

### Note
- This version properly respects kryten-py's abstraction boundaries
- Future request/response functionality will be added to kryten-py first

## [0.2.1] - 2025-01-29

### Fixed
- **CLI Entry Point** - Fixed `kryten-userstats` command failing with "coroutine 'main' was never awaited"
  - Added synchronous `main()` wrapper function in `__main__.py`
  - Renamed async main to `async_main()` and wrapped it with `asyncio.run()`
  - CLI command now works properly with Poetry scripts entry point

### Note
- Version 0.2.0 has a broken CLI command; users should upgrade to 0.2.1
