def subspace_cosine_product(U: torch.Tensor, V: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Compute cosine-product subspace similarity between column spaces of U and V.
    
    Measures how similar two subspaces are by computing the product of cosines of 
    their principal angles. Returns a value between 0 (orthogonal subspaces) and 1 
    (identical subspaces).
    
    Parameters:
    - U: Tensor with orthonormal columns representing first subspace.
         Shape: (n, k) or (batch, n, k)
    - V: Tensor with orthonormal columns representing second subspace.
         Shape: (n, k) or (batch, n, k)
    
    Returns:
    - Similarity score(s):
      * Python float if U and V are 2D
      * Tensor of shape (batch,) if U and V are 3D
    
    Notes:
    - Assumes columns of U and V are orthonormal (e.g., from QR decomposition)
    - Supports both real and complex tensors
    - Uses fast determinant method for square cases, SVD for non-square
