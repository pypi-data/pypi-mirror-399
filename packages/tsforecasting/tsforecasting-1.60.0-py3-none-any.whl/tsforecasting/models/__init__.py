"""Models module for TSForecasting package.

This module provides:
- BaseForecaster: Abstract base class for all forecasters
- AutoGluonForecaster: Special handler for AutoGluon
- Individual forecaster classes (RandomForestForecaster, etc.)
- Legacy aliases (RandomForest_Forecasting, etc.) for backward compatibility
- ModelRegistry: Central registry for model lookup and configuration
