## Installation

### Kivy apps:  

In your **`buildozer.spec`** file, ensure you include the following:

```ini
# Add pyjnius so ensure it's packaged with the build
requirements = python3, kivy, pyjnius, android-notify>=1.60.6.dev0
# Add permission for notifications
android.permissions = POST_NOTIFICATIONS
```

### Flet apps:  

In your `pyproject.toml` file, ensure you include the following:

```toml
[tool.flet.android]
dependencies = [
  "pyjnius","android-notify>=1.60.6.dev0"
]

[tool.flet.android.permission]
"android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" = true
```

### Pydroid 3
In the [pydroid 3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3) mobile app for running python code you can test some features.
- In pip section where you're asked to insert `Libary name` paste `android-notify>=1.60.6.dev0`


### Testing
Can be installed via `pip` For testing purposes:

```bash
pip install android_notify
android-notify -v
```

## Documentation
For Dev Version use
```requirements = python3, kivy, pyjnius, https://github.com/Fector101/android_notify/archive/without-androidx.zip```

### To talk to BroadCast Listener From Buttons

- Make things happen without being in your app
```python

from android_notify import Notification
notification = Notification(title="Reciver Notification")
notification.addButton(text="Stop", receiver_name="CarouselReceiver", action="ACTION_STOP")
notification.addButton(text="Skip", receiver_name="CarouselReceiver", action="ACTION_SKIP")
```
You can use this [wiki](https://github.com/Fector101/android_notify/wiki/How-to#use-with-broadcast-listener-in-kivy) as a guide create a broadcast listener

### To use colored text in your notifications

- Copy the [res](https://github.com/Fector101/android_notify/tree/main/android_notify/res) folder to your app path.  
Lastly in your `buildozer.spec` file
- Add `source.include_exts = xml` and `android.add_resources = ./res`


### To use Custom Sounds

- Put audio files in `res/raw` folder,
- Then from `buildozer.spec` point to res folder `android.add_resources = res`
- and includes it's format `source.include_exts = wav`.

Lastly From the code 
```py
# Create a custom notification channel with a unique sound resource for android 8+
Notification.createChannel(
    id="weird_sound_tester",
    name="Weird Sound Tester",
    description="A test channel used to verify custom notification sounds from the res/raw folder.",
    res_sound_name="sneeze" # file name without .wav or .mp3
)

# Send a notification through the created channel
n=Notification(
    title="Custom Sound Notification",
    message="This tests playback of a custom sound (sneeze.wav) stored in res/raw.",
    channel_id="weird_sound_tester" # important tells notification to use right channel
)
n.setSound("sneeze")# for android 7 below 
n.send()
```
