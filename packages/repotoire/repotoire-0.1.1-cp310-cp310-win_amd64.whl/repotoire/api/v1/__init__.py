# Create v1 FastAPI sub-application
v1_app = FastAPI(
    title="Repotoire API v1",
    description="""
# Repotoire Code Intelligence API v1

Graph-powered code health analysis platform with AI-assisted fixes.

## Overview

Repotoire analyzes codebases using Neo4j knowledge graphs to detect code smells,
architectural issues, and technical debt. Unlike traditional linters that examine
files in isolation, Repotoire builds a graph combining structural analysis (AST),
semantic understanding (NLP + AI), and relational patterns (graph algorithms).

## Version Information

This is **API v1** (stable). For changes between versions, see the migration guide.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication via one of:

### Bearer Token (Clerk JWT)
```
Authorization: Bearer <your-clerk-token>
```

### API Key (for CI/CD)
```
X-API-Key: <your-api-key>
```

## Rate Limits

| Tier | Analyses/Hour | API Calls/Min |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Free | 2 | 60 |
| Pro | 20 | 300 |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | 1000 |
