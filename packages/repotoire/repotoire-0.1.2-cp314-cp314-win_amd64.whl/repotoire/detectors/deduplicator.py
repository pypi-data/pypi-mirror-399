"""Finding deduplication engine for cross-detector collaboration.

This module provides intelligent deduplication of findings from multiple detectors,
reducing noise and improving signal by identifying when multiple detectors agree
on the same issue.

    Identifies when multiple detectors flag the same entity and merges

        - Entity-based deduplication (same affected nodes)
        - Location-based grouping (within proximity threshold)
        - Confidence aggregation from multiple detectors
        - Preserves all detector context via merged_from
