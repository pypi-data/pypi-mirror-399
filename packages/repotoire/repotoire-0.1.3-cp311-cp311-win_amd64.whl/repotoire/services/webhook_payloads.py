"""Webhook payload builders for different event types.

This module provides functions to build standardized webhook payloads
for each supported event type. All payloads follow a consistent structure
with event type, timestamp, and data fields.

Usage:
    from repotoire.services.webhook_payloads import build_analysis_completed_payload

    payload = build_analysis_completed_payload(
        analysis_run_id=run.id,
        repository_id=repo.id,
        repository_name=repo.full_name,
        commit_sha="abc123",
        health_score=85.5,
        finding_counts={"critical": 0, "high": 2, "medium": 5, "low": 10},
        duration_seconds=120,
    )
