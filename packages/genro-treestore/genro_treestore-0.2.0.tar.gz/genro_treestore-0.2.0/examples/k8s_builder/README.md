# K8s Builder Example

**Status**: TO BE UPDATED

This example needs to be rewritten to use the new `BuilderBase` system instead of the removed `TreeStoreBuilder` and `Grammar` classes.

The old example is preserved in `example_old.py` for reference.

## TODO

1. Create `K8sBuilder(BuilderBase)` with dynamic tag methods
2. Keep the resource builder classes (DeploymentBuilder, ServiceBuilder, etc.)
3. Update the fluent API to work with the new system
