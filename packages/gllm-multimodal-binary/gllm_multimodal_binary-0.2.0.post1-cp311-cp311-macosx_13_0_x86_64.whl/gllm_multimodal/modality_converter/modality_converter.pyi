    This class provides a foundation for building modality converter components in Gen AI applications.

        This method validates the input parameters and calls `convert` to perform the modality conversion process.
        It ensures that the required source parameter is provided and valid before proceeding.

        Args:
            source (str | bytes): The source of the modality to convert.
            **kwargs (Any): A dictionary of arguments required for the modality conversion process.
                Must include `source` of type `str`.
                May include additional parameters specific to the implementation.

        Returns:
            TextResult: The result of processing the modality.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If `source` is missing from the input kwargs or is empty.
            TypeError: If `source` is not a string or bytes.
            NotImplementedError: If the method is not implemented in a subclass.
