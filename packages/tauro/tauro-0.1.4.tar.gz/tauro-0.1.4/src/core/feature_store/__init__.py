"""
Feature Store module - Phase 1 Foundation.

Provides both materialized (replicated) and virtualized (query-on-demand) 
feature stores for the Gold layer of Medallion architecture.

Supports three modes of operation:
- Materialized: Pre-computed features stored in physical storage
- Virtualized: Query-on-demand from source layers with data virtualization
- Hybrid: Intelligent switching between materialized and virtualized

Integrates natively with Tauro pipelines using the IO module infrastructure.
Executes in core.exec module context with input/output managers.
