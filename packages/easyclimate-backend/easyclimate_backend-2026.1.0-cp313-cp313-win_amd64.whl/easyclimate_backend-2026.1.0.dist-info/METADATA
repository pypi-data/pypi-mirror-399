## 🤗 What is easyclimate-backend?

The easyclimate-backend is designed to handle the heavy lifting for [easyclimate](https://github.com/shenyulu/easyclimate), 
allowing the front-end package to offer a user-friendly interface for climate analysis. By leveraging the speed and efficiency of ``Fortran`` and ``C``, 
The easyclimate-backend makes sure that even the most computationally intensive tasks are managed seamlessly.



>   🚨 **This package is still undergoing rapid development.** 🚨
>
>   All of the API (functions/classes/interfaces) is subject to change. 
>   There may be non-backward compatible changes as we experiment with new design ideas and implement new features. 
>   This is not a finished product, use with caution.
