class Ransac(CircleDetector):
    r"""
    Detects circles in a set of 2D points using the
    `Random sample consensus (RANSAC) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample_consensus>`__ algorithm. The RANSAC
    algorithm consists of the following steps that are repeated for a certain number of iterations:

    1. A random, minimal subset is sampled from the original set of input points. This subset is called the hypothetical
       inliers. The cardinality of the subset must be sufficient to determine the circle parameters (i.e., it must
       contain at least three points).
    2. A circle is fitted to the set of hypothetical inliers.
    3. All points from the original set of input points are then tested against the fitted circle. All points whose
       distance to the outline of the fitted circle is above some error threshold are considered outliers. The remaining
       points that fit the estimated circle well according to the error threshold are considered the consensus set.
    4. The circle fit is improved by re-estimating it by using all the members of the consensus set.
    5. The quality of fit of the re-estimated circle is evaluated using a scoring function. The circle is accepted if
       its fitting score is above a certain threshold, the cardinality of its consensus set is sufficiently large and
       its parameters lie within a value range specified by the user.

    For the circle fitting in step 2, a least-squares estimator is used, which minimizes the squared distances of the
    points to the circle outline. The implementation of the least-squares estimator is based on that from the
    `scikit-image <https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.measure.html#skimage.measure.CircleModel>`__
    package.

    To measure the quality of fit in step 5, the scoring function proposed in `Garlipp, Tim, and Christine H. Müller. \
    "Detection of Linear and Circular Shapes in Image Analysis." Computational Statistics & Data Analysis 51.3 (2006): \
    1479-1490. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2006.04.022>`__ is used:

    .. math::
        :nowrap:

        \begin{eqnarray}
            H(\begin{bmatrix} a, b, r \end{bmatrix}) = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{s} \rho
            \Biggl(
                \frac{\|\begin{bmatrix}x_i, y_i \end{bmatrix}^T - \begin{bmatrix} a, b \end{bmatrix}^T\| - r}{s}
            \Biggr)
        \end{eqnarray}

    Here, :math:`\{(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_N, y_N)\}` is the set of input points and :math:`(a, b, r)` are the circle
    parameters, :math:`\rho` is a kernel function, and :math:`s` is the kernel bandwidth. The standard Gaussian
    distribution is used as the kernel function and the kernel bandwidth is set to the RANSAC error threshold. Note
    that, unlike the original formulation of the score function by Garlipp and Müller, the mean has been replaced by a
    sum to ensure that the score value is independent of the number of noise points in the input.

    Args:
        bandwidth: Error threshold defining which points are considered outliers.
        iterations: How often the RANSAC procedure is repeated. Increasing the number of iterations increases the
            probability of obtaining at least one fitting circle.
        num_samples: Number of hypothetical inliers to sample in each iteration.
        min_concensus_points: Minimum size the consensus set of a circle must have in order to accept the circle.
        min_fitting_score: Minimum fitting score a circle must have in order to be accepted.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If :code:`num_samples` or :code:`min_concensus_points` are smaller than 3.

    Attributes:
        circles: After the :code:`self.detect()` method has been called, this attribute contains the parameters of the
            detected circles (in the following order: x-coordinate of the center, y-coordinate of the center, radius).
            If the :code:`self.detect()` method has not yet been called, this attribute is an empty array.
        fitting_scores: After the :code:`self.detect()` method has been called, this attribute contains the fitting
            scores of the detected circles (higher means better). If the :code:`self.detect()`
            method has not yet been called, this attribute is an empty array.
        batch_lengths_circles: After the :code:`self.detect()` method has been called, this attribute contains the
            number of circles detected for each batch item (circles belonging to the same batch item are stored
            consecutively in :code:`self.circles`). If the :code:`self.detect()` method has not yet been
            called, this attribute is :code:`[0]`.

        Executes the circle detection on the given input points. The results of the circle detection are stored in

        Args:
            xy: Coordinates of the set of 2D points in which to detect circles. If the :code:`xy` array has a row-major
                storage layout (`numpy's <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/internals.html>`__ default), a copy of the

            batch_lengths: Number of points in each point set of the input batch. For batch processing, it is
                expected that all points belonging to the same point set are stored consecutively in the :code:`xy`
                input array. For example, if the input is a batch of two point sets (i.e., two batch items) with

                is disabled.
            break_min_x: Rejection criterion for circle fitting. If the x-coordinate of a circle center is smaller than
                this value, the respective circle is discarded. Can be either a scalar, an array of values (one per
                batch item), or :code:`None`. If a scalar is provided, the same value is used for all batch items.
                If set to :code:`None`, :math:`(x_{min} - 2s)` is used as the default, where :math:`x_{min}` is the
                minimum of the x-coordinates of the points within a batch item and :math:`s` is the bandwidth.
            break_max_x: Rejection criterion for circle fitting. If the x-coordinate of a circle center is larger than
                this value, the respective circle is discarded. Can be either a scalar, an array of values (one
                per batch item), or :code:`None`. If a scalar is provided, the same value is used for all batch items.
                If set to :code:`None`, :math:`(x_{max} + 2s)` is used as the default, where :math:`x_{max}` is the

            break_min_y: Rejection criterion for circle fitting. If the y-coordinate of a circle center is smaller than

                this value, the respective circle is discarded. Can be either a scalar, an array of values (one

            break_min_radius: Rejection criterion for circle fitting. If the radius of a circle center is smaller than
                this value, the respective circle is discarded. Can be either a scalar, an array of values (one per
                batch item), or :code:`None`. If a scalar is provided, the same value is used for all batch items. If
                set to :code:`None`, zero is used as the default.
            break_max_radius:  Rejection criterion for circle fitting. If the radius of a circle center is larger than
                this value, the respective circle is discarded. Can be either a scalar, an array of values (one per
                batch item), or :code:`None`. If a scalar is provided, the same value is used for all batch items. If
                set to :code:`None`, :math:`max(x_{max} - x_{min}, y_{max} - y_{min}) + 2s` is used as the default,
                where :math:`s` is the bandwidth and :math:`x_{min}`, :math:`x_{max}`, :math:`y_{min}`, and
                :math:`y_{max}` are the minimum and the maximum of the x- and y-coordinates of the points within a batch
                item, respectively.
            num_workers: Number of workers threads to use for parallel processing. If set to -1, all CPU threads are
                used.
