    Detects circles in a set of 2D points using the M-estimator method proposed in `Garlipp, Tim, and Christine
    H. Müller. "Detection of Linear and Circular Shapes in Image Analysis." Computational Statistics & Data Analysis
    51.3 (2006): 1479-1490. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2006.04.022>`__

    The input of the method a set of 2D points :math:`\{(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_N, y_N)\}`. Circles with different center
    positions and radii are generated as starting values for the circle detection process. The parameters of these
    initial circles are then optimized iteratively to align them with the input points.

    Given a circle with the center :math:`(a, b)` and a radius :math:`r`, the circle parameters are optimized
    by minimizing the following loss function (note that in the work by Garlipp and Müller, the function is formulated
    as a score function to be maximized and therefore has a positive instead of a negative sign):

    .. math::
        :nowrap:

        \begin{eqnarray}
            L(\begin{bmatrix} a, b, r \end{bmatrix}) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{s} \rho
            \Biggl(
                \frac{\|\begin{bmatrix}x_i, y_i \end{bmatrix}^T - \begin{bmatrix} a, b \end{bmatrix}^T\| - r}{s}
            \Biggr)
        \end{eqnarray}

    Here, :math:`\rho` is a kernel function and :math:`s` is the kernel bandwidth. In this implementation, the standard
    Gaussian distribution with :math:`\mu = 0` and :math:`\sigma = 1` is used as the kernel function:

    .. math::
        :nowrap:

        \begin{eqnarray}
            \rho(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}
        \end{eqnarray}

    To minimize the loss function :math:`L`,
    `Newton's method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method_in_optimization>`__ is used. In each
    optimization step, this method updates the parameters as follows:

    .. math::
        :nowrap:

        \begin{eqnarray}
            \begin{bmatrix} a, b, r \end{bmatrix}_{t+1} = \begin{bmatrix} a, b, r \end{bmatrix}_t - s \cdot
            \nabla L([a, b, r]) \cdot \biggl[\nabla^2 L([a, b, r])\biggr]^{-1}
        \end{eqnarray}

    Here, :math:`s` is the step size. Since the Newton step requires to compute the inverse of the Hessian
    matrix of the loss function :math:`\bigl[\nabla^2 L([a, b, r])\bigr]^{-1}`, it can not be applied if the
    Hessian matrix is not invertible. Additionally, the Newton step only moves towards a local minimum if the
    determinant of the Hessian matrix is positive. Therefore, a simple gradient descent update step is used instead of
    the Newton step if the determinant of the Hessian matrix is not positive:

    .. math::
        :nowrap:

        \begin{eqnarray}
            \begin{bmatrix} a, b, r \end{bmatrix}_{t+1} = \begin{bmatrix} a, b, r \end{bmatrix}_t - s \cdot
            \nabla L([a, b, r])
        \end{eqnarray}

    To determine a suitable step size :math:`s` for each step that results in a sufficient decrease of the loss
    function, the following rules are used:

    1. The initial step size :math:`s_0` is set to 1.
    2. If gradient descent is used in the optimization step, the step size is repeatedly increased by multiplying it
       with an acceleration factor :math:`\alpha > 1`, as long as increasing the step size results in a greater decrease
       of the loss function for the step. More formally, the step size update :math:`s_{k+1} = \alpha \cdot s_k` is
       repeated as long as the following condition is fullfilled:

       .. math::
           :nowrap:

           \begin{eqnarray}
           L(c + s_{k+1} \cdot d) < L(c + s_k \cdot d),
           \end{eqnarray}

       Here, :math:`d` is the step direction, :math:`c = [a, b, r]_{t}` are the circle's current parameters, and
       :math:`k` is the number of acceleration steps. No acceleration is applied for steps using Newton's method,
       as the Newton method itself includes an adjustment of the step size.

    3. If the gradient descent step size is not increased in (2) or Newton's method is used,
       the initial step size may be still too large to produce a sufficient decrease of the loss function. In this case,
       the initial step size is decreased until the step results in a sufficient decrease of the loss function. For this
       purpose, a `backtracking line-search <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking_line_search>`__ according to
       `Armijo's rule <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxh2kqVz6lk>`__ is performed. Armijo's rule has two
       hyperparameters :math:`\beta \in (0, 1)` and :math:`\gamma \in (0,1)`. The step size is repeatedly decreased by
       multiplying it with the attenuation factor :math:`\beta` until the decrease of the loss function is at least a
       fraction :math:`\gamma` of the loss decrease expected based on a linear approximation of the loss function by its
       first-order Taylor polynomial. More formally, Armijo's rule repeats the step size update
       :math:`s_{k+1} = \beta \cdot s_k` until the following condition is fullfilled:

       .. math::
            :nowrap:

            \begin{eqnarray}
            L(c) - L(c + s_k \cdot d) \geq - \gamma \cdot s_k \cdot \nabla L(c) d^T
            \end{eqnarray}


    To be able to identify circles at different positions and of different sizes, the optimization is repeated with
    different starting values for the initial circle parameters. The starting values for the center coordinates
    :math:`(a, b)` are generated by placing points on a regular grid. The limits of the grid in x- and y-direction
    are defined by the parameters :code:`min_start_x`, :code:`max_start_x`, :code:`min_start_y`, and
    :code:`max_start_y`. The number of grid points is defined by the parametrs :code:`n_start_x` and :code:`n_start_y`.
    For each start position, :code:`n_start_radius` different starting values for the circle radius are tested, evenly
    covering the interval between :code:`min_start_radius ` and :code:`max_start_radius`.

    To filter out circles for which the optimization does not converge, allowed value ranges are defined for the circle
    parameters by :code:`break_min_x`, :code:`break_max_x`, :code:`break_min_y`, :code:`break_max_y`,
    :code:`break_min_radius`, and :code:`break_max_radius`. If the parameters of a circle leave these value ranges
    during optimization, the optimization of the respective circle is terminated and the circle is discarded.

        armijo_min_decrease_percentage: Hyperparameter :math:`\gamma` for the backtracking line-search according to
            Armijo's rule.
        min_step_size: Minimum step width. If the step size attenuation according to Armijo's rule results in a step
            size below this step size, the attenuation of the step size is terminated.

        min_fitting_score: Minimum fitting score (equal to :math:`-1 \cdot N \cdot` fitting loss where :math:`N` is the
            number of input points) that a circle must have in order not to be discarded.

        circles: After the :code:`self.detect()` method has been called, this attribute contains the parameters of the
            detected circles (in the following order: x-coordinate of the center, y-coordinate of the center, radius).
            If the :code:`self.detect()` method has not yet been called, this attribute is an empty array.
        fitting_scores: After the :code:`self.detect()` method has been called, this attribute contains the fitting
            scores of the detected circles (equal to :math:`-1 \cdot N \cdot` fitting loss where :math:`N` is the number
            of input points, higher means better). If the :code:`self.detect()` method has not yet been called, this
            attribute is an empty array.

            called, this attribute is :code:`[0]`.

        Args:
            xy: Coordinates of the set of 2D points in which to detect circles. If the :code:`xy` array has a row-major
