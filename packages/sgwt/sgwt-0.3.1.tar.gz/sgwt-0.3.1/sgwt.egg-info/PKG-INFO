A high-performance Python library for sparse Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and Spectral Graph Wavelet Transforms (SGWT). This package leverages the ``CHOLMOD`` library for efficient sparse direct solvers, providing significant speedups over traditional dense or iterative methods for large-scale graph convolution.

Key Features
------------

- **High-Performance Sparse Solvers**: Direct integration with the ``CHOLMOD`` library for optimized sparse Cholesky factorizations and linear system solves.
- **Generalized Graph Convolution**: Support for arbitrary spectral kernels via rational approximation (*Kernel Fitting*) and standard analytical filters (low-pass, band-pass, high-pass).
- **Dynamic Topology Support**: Specialized routines for graphs with evolving structures, utilizing efficient rank-1 updates for real-time topology changes.
- **Resource-Aware Execution**: Context-managed memory allocation and workspace reuse to minimize overhead in high-throughput applications.
- **Integrated Graph Repository**: Built-in access to standardized graph Laplacians and signals from power systems and infrastructure networks.

Other
-----

This module is also implemented 
in `Julia <https://github.com/lukelowry/SpectralGraphWavelet.jl>`_ which takes advantage of 
the native SuiteSparse support. Although, it is not as well documented or tested.
