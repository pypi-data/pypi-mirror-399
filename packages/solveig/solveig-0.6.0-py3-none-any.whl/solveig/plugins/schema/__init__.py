# The `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block is a standard Python trick to solve a circular import problem.
#
# The Problem:
# 1. This file needs to know what a `Requirement` is for type hinting (`def register(cls: type[Requirement])`).
# 2. However, the file that defines `Requirement` (`solveig/schema/requirement/base.py`) needs
#    to import from the `plugins` package to run hooks.
# 3. This creates a circular dependency: `plugins` -> `schema` -> `plugins`, which would crash the application.
#
# The Solution:
# - At RUNTIME, `TYPE_CHECKING` is `False`. Python skips this import, breaking the circle. The code
#   still works due to Python's dynamic nature ("duck typing").
# - During STATIC ANALYSIS (when you run `mypy`), `TYPE_CHECKING` is `True`. The import happens,
#   allowing `mypy` to correctly validate the types.

# A TypeVar is used to tell the type checker that the decorator returns the exact same class
# that it received as an argument. This preserves the specific type (e.g., `TreeRequirement`)
# for better static analysis downstream.
