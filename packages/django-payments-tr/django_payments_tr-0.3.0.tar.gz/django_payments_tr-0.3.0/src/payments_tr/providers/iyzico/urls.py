URL configuration for iyzico provider.

Include these URLs in your project's urls.py:

    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        # ... your other URL patterns
        path('iyzico/', include('payments_tr.providers.iyzico.urls')),
    ]

This will create the following endpoints:
    - /iyzico/callback/ - 3D Secure callback (called by Iyzico)
    - /iyzico/webhook/ - Webhook handler (called by Iyzico)
    - /iyzico/webhook/test/ - Test webhook (development only, DEBUG mode)
