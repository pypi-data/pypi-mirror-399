# CI-only checks (not suitable for pre-commit):
# - pytest (tests should run separately, not on every commit)
# - pip-audit (requires full environment, better in CI)
# - safety (requires API key for full functionality)
# - twine check (requires built package)
# - coverage thresholds (requires full test run)
