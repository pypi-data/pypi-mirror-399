This module allows you to define a customer-specific product data
structure (patterned after the standard supplier/vendor info) on the
product form.

This structure enables defining customized information for each customer
and product, including:

::

   - Custom Price (Price-list price)
   - Customer Product Name
   - Customer Product Code
   - Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ)

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

For these prices to be used in sale prices calculations, you will have
to create a pricelist with a rule with option "Based on" with the value
"Partner Prices: Take the price from the customer info on the 'product
form')".

Usage
=====

There's a new section on *Sales* tab of the product form called
"Customers", where you can define records for customers with the same
structure of the suppliers.

There's a new option on pricelist items that allows to get the prices
from the supplierinfo at the product form.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Product prices through this method are only guaranteed on the standard
  sale order workflow. Other custom flows maybe don't reflect the price.
- The minimum quantity will neither apply on sale orders.
