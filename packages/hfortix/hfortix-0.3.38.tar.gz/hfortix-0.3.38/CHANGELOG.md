## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.38] - 2025-12-29

### Added

- **Traffic Shaper Convenience Wrappers**: Production-ready wrappers for FortiOS traffic shaping
  - `ShaperPerIp`: Per-IP traffic shaper for bandwidth and session limits per source IP
    - Parameters: max_bandwidth, bandwidth_unit, session limits, DiffServ settings
    - Methods: create(), get(), update(), delete(), exists()
  - `TrafficShaper`: Shared traffic shaper with guaranteed/maximum bandwidth
    - Parameters: guaranteed/maximum bandwidth, priority, DiffServ, CoS, overhead
    - Methods: create(), get(), update(), delete(), exists()
  - Comprehensive parameter validation (name length, bandwidth ranges, enum values)
  - Accessible via `fgt.firewall.shaper_per_ip` and `fgt.firewall.traffic_shaper`
  - Complete test suite: 20 tests passing, 1 skipped (CoS requires VLAN)

### Changed

- **Rename Method Behavior**: Updated `rename()` methods to raise `NotImplementedError`
  - FortiOS does not support renaming shaper objects (name is immutable primary key)
  - Shapers use name-based URLs (`/firewall.shaper/traffic-shaper/{name}`)
  - Unlike shaping policies which use ID-based URLs and support renaming
  - Methods now raise clear error explaining limitation and workaround
  - Tests updated to verify NotImplementedError is raised correctly

### Documentation

- **Documentation Reorganization**: Improved structure and organization
  - Created `docs/wrappers/` folder for wrapper-specific documentation
  - New `CONVENIENCE_WRAPPERS.md` - Overview guide for all convenience wrappers (START HERE)
  - Moved `FIREWALL_POLICY_WRAPPER.md` to `docs/wrappers/`
  - Moved `SHAPER_WRAPPERS.md` to `docs/wrappers/`
  - Renamed `SCHEDULE_CONVENIENCE_METHODS.md` to `SCHEDULE_WRAPPERS.md` and moved to `docs/wrappers/`
  - Removed outdated `FIX_WINDOWS_INSTALL.md` (issue fixed in v0.3.33)
  - Moved `PYPI_SETUP.md` to `X/docs/` (development-only documentation)
  - Updated all documentation cross-references to use new paths
  - Clear separation: user docs in `docs/`, dev docs in `X/docs/`
- **Shaper Wrappers Guide**: New comprehensive documentation (`docs/wrappers/SHAPER_WRAPPERS.md`)
  - Quick start examples and API reference for both shaper types
  - Detailed parameter documentation with validation rules
  - Important limitations section explaining rename restriction
  - Comparison table: shapers (name-based) vs shaping policies (ID-based)
  - 7 complete examples covering common use cases
  - Troubleshooting guide and best practices
- **API Investigation Results**: Documented FortiOS shaper API behavior (`X/SHAPER_API_INVESTIGATION.md`)
  - Confirmed no numeric ID field exists for shaper objects
  - Verified rename operations silently fail (FortiOS ignores name changes)
  - Compared shaper endpoints (name-based) vs policy endpoints (ID-based)
  - Test results showing API responses and rename attempts

## [0.3.37] - 2025-12-29

### Added

- **Firewall Service Convenience Wrappers**: New high-level wrappers for firewall service management
  - `ServiceCategory`: Manage firewall service categories with simplified syntax
  - `ServiceCustom`: Create and manage custom services (TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP protocols)
  - `ServiceGroup`: Manage service groups with member add/remove operations
  - Full CRUD operations with parameter validation and automatic data normalization
  - Accessible via `fgt.firewall.service_category`, `fgt.firewall.service_custom`, `fgt.firewall.service_group`

### Fixed

- **Rename Functionality**: Fixed critical bug in `data` parameter handling for all rename operations
  - Modified `build_cmdb_payload()` and `build_cmdb_payload_normalized()` in `api/_helpers/helpers.py`
  - The `data` parameter is now properly merged into the payload instead of being nested as `{"data": {...}}`
  - This fixes rename operations for ServiceGroup, ServiceCustom, and ServiceCategory
  - All 40 firewall service tests now passing, including previously failing rename tests

### Changed

- **Rename Method Signature**: Standardized parameter naming across all service wrappers
  - Changed from `rename(old_name, new_name)` to `rename(name, new_name)` for consistency
  - Affects: `ServiceGroup.rename()`, `ServiceCustom.rename()`, `ServiceCategory.rename()`
  - Matches the pattern used by other wrapper methods (update, delete, etc.)

### Documentation

- **Code Quality**: Fixed all PEP8 E501 line length violations in firewall wrapper files
  - Wrapped long docstrings, error messages, and examples to comply with 79 character limit
  - Improved code readability while maintaining all functionality
  - All pre-release checks now passing (flake8, mypy, black, isort, bandit)

## [0.3.36] - 2025-12-25

### Fixed

- **Firewall Policy Rename**: Simplified `rename()` method - FortiOS supports updating name field directly
  - Removed unnecessary workaround that fetched and included logtraffic field
  - Method now simply calls `update(policy_id, name)` as originally intended
  - Re-enabled 3 rename tests that were incorrectly marked as skipped

- **Critical Packaging Issue**: Fixed `.gitignore` pattern excluding password-related modules
  - Changed `*password*` to `/*password*` to only ignore root-level credential files
  - This was preventing `password_policy.py` and related modules from being included in git and PyPI packages
  - Affected files now properly included:
    - `hfortix/FortiOS/api/v2/cmdb/system/password_policy.py`
    - `hfortix/FortiOS/api/v2/cmdb/system/password_policy_guest_admin.py`
    - `hfortix/FortiOS/api/v2/cmdb/user/password_policy.py`
    - `hfortix/FortiOS/api/v2/monitor/system/change_password.py`
    - `hfortix/FortiOS/api/v2/monitor/system/password_policy_conform.py`
    - `hfortix/FortiOS/api/v2/monitor/user/password_policy_conform.py`
    - All related helper files
  - Fixes `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hfortix.FortiOS.api.v2.cmdb.system.password_policy'`

## [0.3.35] - 2025-12-25

### Fixed

- **Package Build**: Ensures `password_policy.py` is included in PyPI distribution
  - This file was missing in the PyPI v0.3.34 release
  - All password policy modules are now properly included
  - Fixes `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hfortix.FortiOS.api.v2.cmdb.system.password_policy'`

- **Firewall Policy**: Fixed `exists()` method exception handling
  - Now returns `False` for non-existent policies instead of raising exception
  - Wrapped `_api.exists()` call in try/except block
  - Matches expected behavior for convenience wrappers

- **Markdown Linting**: Disabled overly strict markdown linting rules
  - Disabled MD022, MD032, MD036, MD031, MD026
  - Allows more flexible documentation formatting
  - All pre-commit hooks now pass

### Changed

- **Documentation Organization**: Moved documentation files to `docs/` directory
  - `SCHEDULE_CONVENIENCE_METHODS.md` → `docs/SCHEDULE_CONVENIENCE_METHODS.md`
  - `FIX_WINDOWS_INSTALL.md` → `docs/FIX_WINDOWS_INSTALL.md`
  - Cleaner root directory structure

- **CI/CD Optimization**: Skip workflows on documentation-only changes
  - Added `paths-ignore` for `docs/**`, `*.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`
  - Applies to both `ci.yml` and `codeql.yml` workflows
  - Saves CI minutes and speeds up documentation updates

## [0.3.34] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **Schedule Convenience Methods**: Added comprehensive convenience methods to all schedule types
  - **New Methods** (available for `schedule_onetime`, `schedule_recurring`, `schedule_group`):
    - `get_by_name(name, vdom=None)`: Returns schedule data directly (not full API response)
    - `rename(name, new_name, vdom=None)`: Rename a schedule in one call
    - `clone(name, new_name, **overrides, vdom=None)`: Clone schedule with optional modifications
  - **Response Helpers** (added to `hfortix.FortiOS.api._helpers`):
    - `get_mkey(response)`: Extract created object's name from response
    - `is_success(response)`: Check if operation succeeded
    - `get_results(response)`: Extract results from response
  - Matches the convenience method pattern from `firewallPolicy`
  - Makes schedule management more user-friendly and consistent
  - See `docs/SCHEDULE_CONVENIENCE_METHODS.md` for full documentation
  - See `examples/schedule_convenience_demo.py` for usage examples

- **IP/MAC Binding Modules**: New modules for firewall IP/MAC binding management
  - `ipmacBindingSetting`: Manage IP/MAC binding settings
  - `ipmacBindingTable`: Manage IP/MAC binding table entries
  - **Core Methods**:
    - `create(seq_num, ip, mac, name=None, status='enable', vdom=None)`: Create new binding
    - `update(seq_num, **kwargs, vdom=None)`: Update existing binding
    - `delete(seq_num, vdom=None)`: Delete binding
    - `get(seq_num=None, vdom=None)`: Get binding(s) by sequence number

- **Firewall Policy Helpers Module**: New `_helpers.py` module with validation utilities
  - Extracted common validation logic from firewall policy modules
  - Functions for validating sequence numbers, IP addresses, MAC addresses, etc.
  - Improves code reusability and maintainability

### Changed

- **Documentation Organization**: Moved documentation files to `docs/` directory
  - `SCHEDULE_CONVENIENCE_METHODS.md` → `docs/SCHEDULE_CONVENIENCE_METHODS.md`
  - `FIX_WINDOWS_INSTALL.md` → `docs/FIX_WINDOWS_INSTALL.md`
  - Cleaner root directory structure

### Fixed

- **PEP8 Compliance**: Fixed line length violations in multiple files

  - `hfortix/FortiOS/firewall/firewallPolicy.py`: Split long comment
  - `hfortix/FortiOS/http_client_async.py`: Shortened log message
- **Security**: Fixed bandit warning B104 in IP validation (false positive)
  - Added `# nosec B104` comment to IP wildcard validation check
  - This is validation code, not a network binding operation

### Development

- **Pre-release Tooling Improvements**:
  - Added bandit security scanning to pre-release checks
  - Added pre-commit hooks integration to auto-fix script
  - Pre-release process now catches security and formatting issues earlier
- **TestPyPI Support**: Added upload script and documentation
  - New `upload_to_testpypi.sh` script for testing releases
  - `docs/TESTPYPI_GUIDE.md` with complete setup instructions
  - **WARNING**: Not recommended for test environments - may cause long delays
  - Fail-fast behavior is preserved by default (auto-retry disabled)
  - Available in both sync (`HTTPClient`) and async (`AsyncHTTPClient`) clients
  - Examples:

    ```python
    # Fail-fast (default) - raises CircuitBreakerOpenError immediately
    fgt = FortiOS(host="192.0.2.10", token="api_token")

    # Auto-retry - waits 5 seconds between retries (up to 3 attempts)
    fgt = FortiOS(
        host="192.0.2.10",
        token="api_token",
        circuit_breaker_auto_retry=True,
        circuit_breaker_max_retries=3,
        circuit_breaker_retry_delay=5.0  # Wait 5s between retries
    )

    # Custom retry delay for slower recovery scenarios
    fgt = FortiOS(
        host="192.0.2.10",
        token="api_token",
        circuit_breaker_auto_retry=True,
        circuit_breaker_max_retries=5,
        circuit_breaker_retry_delay=10.0  # Wait 10s between retries
    )
    ```

- **Pytest Test Suites**: Comprehensive test coverage for convenience wrapper classes
  - `examples/ipmacbinding_test_suite.py`: 19 tests covering IP/MAC binding CRUD operations
    - Tests: create, read, update, delete operations
    - Validation: IP addresses, MAC addresses, status values, name length
    - Convenience methods: enable(), disable(), exists()
    - Error handling: duplicate entries, non-existent resources
    - List operations and cleanup fixtures
  - `examples/circuit_breaker_test.py`: Circuit breaker behavior demonstration
    - Fail-fast vs auto-retry comparison
    - Circuit breaker state transitions
    - Recovery scenarios with valid endpoints
  - All tests use pytest framework with fixtures for cleanup
  - Tests validate both convenience wrappers and direct API access

### Changed

- **Circuit Breaker Defaults**: Adjusted thresholds for better testing and general use
  - `circuit_breaker_threshold`: 5 → 10 consecutive failures (more tolerant)
  - `circuit_breaker_timeout`: 60.0s → 30.0s (faster recovery)
  - **Rationale**: Previous settings (5 failures, 60s timeout) were too aggressive for:
    - Testing environments where some failures are expected
    - Development workflows with frequent code changes
    - Networks with occasional transient issues
  - New settings still provide circuit breaker protection while being more practical
  - Users can override via `circuit_breaker_threshold` and `circuit_breaker_timeout` parameters if needed

- **FirewallPolicy.exists()**: Enhanced to support lookup by name or policy ID
  - Added optional `name` parameter for checking policy existence by name
  - `policy_id` parameter is now optional (either `policy_id` or `name` required)
  - Maintains backward compatibility - existing code using `policy_id` continues to work
  - **Performance Note**: Using `name` performs a recursive lookup (slower), while `policy_id` uses direct API call (faster)
  - Improves API consistency with schedule wrapper methods
  - Examples:
    ```python
    # Direct lookup by ID (recommended for performance)
    exists = fgt.firewall.policy.exists(policy_id=5)

    # Lookup by name (convenient but slower)
    exists = fgt.firewall.policy.exists(name="Allow-Web-Traffic")
    ```

try:
    fgt.api.cmdb.firewall.policy.post(data=...)
except DuplicateEntryError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# New capabilities available
try:
    fgt.api.cmdb.firewall.policy.post(data=...)
except DuplicateEntryError as e:
    print(f"Request ID: {e.request_id}")
    print(f"Timestamp: {e.timestamp}")

  - Wrapped docstrings to 79 characters
  - Split long log messages across lines
  - Added strategic noqa comments for unavoidable long lines

### Removed

## [0.3.21] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed

- **Type Errors in Core Modules**: Fixed multiple type checking errors across the codebase
  - **fortios.py line 472**: Fixed `Operator "in" not supported for types "Literal[' ']" and "str | None"`
    - Added None check before using `in` operator for token validation
    - Changed from `if has_token:` to `if has_token and token is not None:`
  - **firewallPolicy.py**: Fixed return type mismatches for API method calls (5 locations)
    - Added `Coroutine` to type imports for proper type hint support
    - Added `# type: ignore[return-value]` comments at lines 733, 777, 1220, 1246, 1455
    - Issue: API methods return `Union[dict, Coroutine]` for async/sync compatibility
    - Wrapper methods declare strict `Dict` return types for better IDE autocomplete
  - **performance_test.py**: Fixed dynamic attribute access errors
    - Line 323: Added `hasattr` check before calling dynamic `get()` method
    - Line 359: Replaced non-existent `logout()` method with `close()` method
  - All reported type errors now resolved while maintaining full functionality

- **Type Annotation Runtime Error**: Fixed `NameError: name 'Coroutine' is not defined` error
  - Added `from __future__ import annotations` to 832 files across the entire API codebase
  - Issue: `Coroutine` type was imported in `TYPE_CHECKING` blocks (False at runtime) but used in runtime type annotations
  - Solution: Deferred evaluation of all type annotations using PEP 563 (`__future__.annotations`)
  - Enables proper type checking while avoiding runtime evaluation errors
  - Affected files: All API endpoint modules (cmdb, log, monitor, service)
  - Created automated fix script (`fix_coroutine_imports.py`) for systematic resolution
  - All tests now pass without runtime type annotation errors

    ```

- **Username/Password Authentication**: Alternative authentication method for FortiOS devices
  - Session-based authentication using username and password (alternative to API tokens)
  - Automatic login on initialization, automatic logout on context manager exit
  - Context manager support for automatic session cleanup: `with FortiOS(username="admin", password="***") as fgt:`
  - Proactive session refresh to prevent idle timeout expiration
  - Configurable session idle timeout (default: 5 minutes, matching FortiGate defaults)
  - Automatic re-authentication on 401 errors if session expires
  - Session tracking with last activity timestamps
  - **⚠️ Deprecation Notice**: Username/password authentication **still works in FortiOS 7.4.x** but is **removed in FortiOS 7.6.x and later**. Fortinet recommends using API token authentication for all new deployments. See [FortiOS 7.4 Release Notes](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.4.0/fortios-release-notes).
  - **Important**: Proactive re-authentication only works with context manager (`with` statement). Without context manager, you must manually manage login/logout.
  - **Note**: The idle timer resets on each API request. Proactive re-auth triggers when time since *last request* exceeds the threshold (not time since login).
  - Examples:
    ```python
    # Recommended: Context manager (automatic login/logout + proactive re-auth)
    with FortiOS(host="fw", username="admin", password="***") as fgt:
        addresses = fgt.api.cmdb.firewall.address.get()
        # Session automatically refreshed if approaching timeout
        # Auto-logout on exit

    # Custom timeout (match your FortiGate's remoteauthtimeout setting)
    with FortiOS(host="fw", username="admin", password="***",
                 session_idle_timeout=120) as fgt:  # 2 minutes
        # Proactive re-auth at 96 seconds (80% of 120s)
        status = fgt.api.monitor.system.status.get()

    # Disable proactive re-authentication
    with FortiOS(host="fw", username="admin", password="***",
                 session_idle_timeout=None) as fgt:
        # Will only re-auth on 401 errors
        addresses = fgt.api.cmdb.firewall.address.get()
    ```
  - Implementation details:
    - Login via POST to `/logincheck` with `secretkey` parameter (FortiOS convention)
    - CSRF token extracted from `ccsrftoken` cookie
    - Session cookies managed automatically by httpx client
    - Logout via POST to `/logout` (clears session, sets cookies to expire in 1976)
    - Proactive re-auth triggered at 80% of idle timeout (before expiration)
    - Fallback re-auth on 401 Unauthorized responses
    - Session timestamps: `_session_created_at`, `_session_last_activity`

- **Firewall Policy Convenience Wrapper**: Intuitive, GUI-like interface for managing firewall policies
  - Access via `fgt.firewall.policy` namespace with explicit parameter names
  - Simplified syntax: `fgt.firewall.policy.create(name='MyPolicy', srcintf=['port1'], ...)` instead of complex REST API calls
  - Auto-normalizes inputs: accepts strings or lists, converts to FortiOS format automatically
  - Full CRUD operations: `.create()`, `.update()`, `.get()`, `.delete()`, `.exists()`
  - Convenience methods: `.enable()`, `.disable()`, `.move()`, `.clone()`
  - Supports all 100+ firewall policy parameters from FortiOS 7.6.5 API
  - Works with both sync and async modes
  - Examples:
    ```python
    # Create policy with intuitive syntax
    fgt.firewall.policy.create(
        name='Allow-Web',
        srcintf=['port1'],
        dstintf=['port2'],
        srcaddr=['internal-net'],
        dstaddr=['all'],
        service=['HTTP', 'HTTPS'],
        action='accept',
        nat='enable'
    )

    # Enable/disable policies
    fgt.firewall.policy.disable(policy_id=10)
    fgt.firewall.policy.enable(policy_id=10)

    # Move policy
    fgt.firewall.policy.move(policy_id=5, position='before', reference_id=3)

    # Clone policy with modifications
    fgt.firewall.policy.clone(policy_id=1, new_name='Cloned-Policy')
    ```

### Changed

- **🔄 MAJOR API REFACTORING** (December 2025) - **All 500+ endpoints refactored**
  - **Breaking Change**: Standardized method names across all endpoints
  - **Old API**: `create()`, `update()`, `delete()` - required manual `mkey` parameter handling
  - **New API**: `list()`, `get()`, `create()`, `update()`, `delete()` - RESTful and intuitive
  - **Dual-Pattern Interface**: All `create()` and `update()` methods now support:
    - Dictionary pattern: `create(data_dict={'name': 'x', 'subnet': '10.0.0.0/24'})`
    - Keyword pattern: `create(name='x', subnet='10.0.0.0/24')`
    - Mixed pattern: `create(data_dict=base_config, name='override')`
  - **Benefits**: Cleaner code, better IDE autocomplete, template-friendly, more Pythonic
  - **Migration**: Old code will break - update `create(data)` → `create(data_dict=data)`
  - **Scope**: All 37 CMDB categories + 32 Monitor categories refactored with unified generator
  - **Scope**: 200+ endpoints across 24 CMDB categories refactored
  - **Status**: ~85% complete, router endpoints verified with comprehensive tests

- **Repository Organization** (December 19, 2025)
  - Moved development tools (CONTRIBUTING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md) to development workspace
  - Cleaned up public documentation to focus on user-facing content
  - Simplified README.md contributing section
  - Updated all documentation cross-references

- **Module Naming Improvements** (December 19, 2025)
  - Fixed invalid Python identifiers: renamed `3g_modem` → `modem_3g`, `5g_modem` → `modem_5g`
  - Module classes: `Modem3g`, `Modem5g` with proper attribute access
  - Test files updated to match new naming convention
  - All modem tests now passing

- **Development Workflow** (December 19, 2025)
  - Created unified module generator handling all edge cases automatically
  - Auto-detects digit-prefixed names and sanitizes to valid Python identifiers
  - Auto-adds certificate helper methods for certificate endpoints
  - Generates nested resource classes for complex endpoints
  - Detects read-only endpoints and generates appropriate methods
  - Consolidated all generation tools into single location
  - All new modules follow standardized dual-pattern interface

- **Singleton Endpoint Pattern** - Important behavioral note for routing protocols
  - Routing protocol endpoints (BGP, OSPF, RIP, ISIS, etc.) work differently than other endpoints
  - Unlike firewall addresses or policies, you cannot add/remove individual neighbors or networks
  - Instead, you must retrieve the entire configuration, make changes, and send it back
  - This requires more code than typical CRUD operations (see README examples)
  - **Why?** FortiOS API design - routing configs are single objects with nested lists
  - **Future:** Helper methods like `add_neighbor()`, `remove_neighbor()` are planned to simplify this

## [0.3.13] - 2025-12-17

    * `Timeout` → `httpx.ReadTimeout, httpx.WriteTimeout, httpx.PoolTimeout, httpx.ConnectTimeout`
    * `requests.HTTPError` → `httpx.HTTPStatusError`
  - Response API changes: `response.ok` → `response.is_success`
  - Requires: `httpx[http2]>=0.27.0` (previously `requests>=2.31.0`)
  - **No API Changes**: All 644 endpoint methods work unchanged
  - Better foundation for future async support

### Added

- **Automatic Retry Logic** - HTTPClient now automatically retries failed requests with exponential backoff
  - Retries on transient failures: connection errors, timeouts, rate limits (429), server errors (500, 502, 503, 504)
  - Configurable via `max_retries` parameter (default: 3 attempts)
  - Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s (capped at 30s)

  - HTTPClient now strips leading slashes from paths before URL construction
  - Prevents double-slash URLs (e.g., `/api/v2/monitor//firewall/acl`)
  - Backwards compatible: works with both `"firewall/acl"` and `"/firewall/acl"` path formats
  - Affects `request()` and `get_binary()` methods
  - Resolves `ResourceNotFoundError` for monitor endpoints like `firewall.acl.list()`

- **Path Encoding Implementation** - Paths are now properly URL-encoded
  - Special characters in paths are encoded (e.g., spaces → `%20`, `@` → `%40`)
  - Safe characters: `/` (path separator) and `%` (already-encoded marker)
  - Prevents double-encoding of pre-encoded components
  - Example: `"user@domain"` → `"user%40domain"`

- **Binary Response Error Handling** - Improved error handling for non-JSON responses
  - Added try/except around JSON parsing in `_handle_response_errors()`
  - Falls back to standard HTTP error for binary/HTML error pages
  - Logs response size for debugging
  - Handles proxy/firewall error pages gracefully

- **Rate Limit Handling** - HTTP 429 responses now properly handled with retry logic

## [0.3.6] - 2025-12-15

### Improved - IDE Autocomplete Experience 🎯

**Note:** This is an alpha release with internal refactoring for better developer experience.

#### Hidden Internal Methods for Cleaner Autocomplete
- **Generic CRUD methods renamed** - Methods moved to underscore prefix:
  - `cmdb.get()` → `cmdb._get()` (escape hatch for unmapped endpoints)
  - `cmdb.post()` → `cmdb._post()`
  - `cmdb.put()` → `cmdb._put()`
  - `cmdb.delete()` → `cmdb._delete()`
  - Similar changes for log, monitor, service modules
- **Benefit:** IDE now shows only endpoint-specific methods (create, update, list, etc.)
- **Migration:** If you use generic methods directly, add underscore prefix

#### Hidden Internal Client Attributes
- **Client internals renamed** - FortiOS client implementation details:
  - `fgt.session` → `fgt._session`
  - `fgt.url` → `fgt._url`
  - `fgt.verify` → `fgt._verify`
- **Public attributes unchanged:** `host`, `port`, `vdom`, `cmdb`, `monitor`, `log`, `service`
- **Benefit:** Cleaner autocomplete showing only user-facing API

#### Hidden Lazy-Loaded Property Cache
- **Firewall lazy loading internals** - Changed cache naming to double underscore
- **Affects:** 11 firewall endpoints (dos_policy, address, addrgrp, access_proxy, etc.)
- **Benefit:** IDE no longer shows internal cached attributes

### Added
- **`__all__` exports** - Explicit control over public API in all modules
- Better documentation and import suggestions

### Technical Details
- 79+ endpoint files updated to use underscore methods internally
- Follows Python naming conventions (single _ = internal, double __ = private)
- All endpoint-specific methods work as before (no breaking changes)
- All tests passing (8/8 for address, access_proxy)

## [0.3.5] - 2025-12-15
