### Why Synod?

**Single-model agents hallucinate. Synod debates until the wrong idea dies.**

| Problem | Synod Solution |
|---------|----------------|
| Single AI hallucinates | **Multiple models catch each other's mistakes** |
| Context limits run out | **Infinite memory that never forgets** |
| No memory between sessions | **Battle-tested insights persist forever** |
| Can't trust AI suggestions | **Every answer survives adversarial review** |

## The Philosophy

*The future isn't bigger models — it's collective reasoning.*

Why pick a model when you can orchestrate all of them?

For centuries, the most important decisions weren't made by a single authority. They were forged through **structured debate**. In ecclesiastical councils (called *synods*), bishops would gather, propose, critique, and challenge each other. Only after rigorous discourse would the presiding authority synthesize a final judgment.

We built Synod on the same principle. Models converge. Orchestration compounds.

## What is Synod?

Synod is a CLI coding agent that orchestrates **adversarial debates** among multiple AI models.

Instead of asking one AI and hoping it doesn't hallucinate, Synod convenes a council:

- **Bishops** (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, GLM) independently propose solutions
- Each Bishop **critiques the others**, hunting for bugs, edge cases, and flaws
- The **Pope** observes silently, learns from the debate, then synthesizes the answer

The Pope doesn't pick a winner. It distills the best concepts into something better than any single proposal. **Not consensus — synthesis.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (recommended)
pipx install synod-cli

# Or with pip
pip install synod-cli

# Login (opens browser)
synod login

# Start coding
synod
```

That's it. No API keys to copy, no configuration files.

> **Tip:** Use `pipx` for CLI tools — it installs in isolated environments and makes upgrades easy with `pipx upgrade synod-cli`

### The Debate Process

**Stage 0: Classification**
Before convening the council, Synod analyzes your query. Trivial questions get fast answers. Complex problems get full debates.

**Stage 1: Bishop Proposals**
Multiple AI models independently propose solutions in parallel. Each brings different strengths: Claude for reasoning, GPT for breadth, DeepSeek for algorithms.

**Stage 2: Adversarial Critiques**
Each Bishop acts as a Staff Engineer conducting an *adversarial* code review:
- **Security**: Injection, auth bypass, data exposure
- **Correctness**: Bugs, edge cases, race conditions
- **Performance**: O(n²) traps, memory leaks, unbounded growth
- **Production-readiness**: Error handling, logging, observability

**Smart Dynamic Rounds**: Synod uses intelligent exit conditions:

| Complexity | Max Rounds | Early Exit Conditions |
|------------|-----------|----------------------|
| trivial | 0 (skip) | — |
| simple | 1 | — |
| moderate | 2 | High consensus + no critical issues |
| complex | 2 | Only minor issues found |
| expert | 3 | Issues resolved/decreasing |

The CLI shows exactly why debate concluded:
```
✓ Debate concluded early (round 1/2)
   → High consensus (87%) with no critical issues.
   Issues: 🔴 0 critical  🟡 2 moderate  🟢 3 minor
```

**Stage 3: Pope Synthesis**
The Pope is a neutral observer. It hardly participates during debate, staying unbiased. After models argue, it synthesizes — not by picking a winner, but by distilling the best concepts into something new.

The Pope catches when all models agreed on the wrong approach. Consensus can be collective blindness. That's why there's a Pope.

## Adversarial Memory

Synod memories are **verified by multiple AI models before storage**. Every insight survives debate before it's remembered.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Synod Adversarial Memory:                                  │
│                                                             │
│    Claude ──┐                                               │
│    GPT ─────┼→ Critique each other → Pope verifies → Store  │
│    Gemini ──┘                                               │
│                                                             │
│  Context never dies. Infinite memory. Infinite context.     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it matters:**
- Memories from high-consensus debates get higher confidence scores
- Insights that survived adversarial critique are more trustworthy
- Skills are only learned when multiple models agreed on the approach
- Automatic decay removes stale memories over time
- Cross-project learning from your coding patterns

**What Synod remembers:**

| Memory Type | Scope | Examples |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| `preference` | User | "Prefers TypeScript over JavaScript" |
| `pattern` | User | "Often uses async/await over .then()" |
| `fact` | User | "Familiar with React and Next.js" |
| `correction` | User | "Corrected: use useState not useRef" |
| `skill` | User (Pro+) | Reusable patterns from successful debates |
| `architecture` | Project | "Uses microservices with API gateway" |
| `convention` | Project | "Uses snake_case for database fields" |
| `bug` | Project | "Auth middleware has race condition" |
| `decision` | Project | "Chose PostgreSQL for ACID compliance" |

**Skills (Pro+ only):**
Skills are reusable patterns extracted from high-quality debates:
- Only extracted when consensus ≥ 70% AND no critical issues
- Stored with higher deduplication threshold (0.90)
- Automatically suggested for similar future problems

**Memory Commands:**
```bash
synod> /memory           # View memory dashboard
synod> /memory show      # Display local context files
synod> /memory graph     # Visualize memory connections (Pro)
synod> /memory timeline  # Show memory activity over time
```

## Features

### Multi-Model Debate
- **6 AI providers**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, DeepSeek, Zhipu
- **Adversarial critiques** catch errors single models miss
- **Pope synthesis** — not consensus, synthesis
- **Answers that survive hostile code review**

### Infinite Memory & Context
- **Context never dies**: Semantic memory that grows with you
- **Cross-project learning**: Patterns from one project help another
- **Verified memories**: Only insights that survived debate get stored
- **Confidence scoring**: High-consensus memories ranked higher
- **Smart retrieval**: Only relevant memories injected (no token waste)

### Smart & Fast
- **Intelligent routing**: Trivial questions get fast answers, complex problems get full debates
- **Smart dynamic rounds**: Complexity-based round caps with intelligent early exit
- **Issue-aware exit**: Critical issues force continued debate, minor issues allow early exit
- **Parallel execution**: All bishops propose simultaneously
- **Token efficiency**: Pay for intelligence, not repetition

### Privacy-First (Zero Storage)
- **Nothing is saved**: Your queries and code are never stored on our servers
- **Pass-through only**: Data flows to AI providers and back, then it's gone
- **Memories are semantic**: Only extracted insights stored as embeddings (not raw text)
- **BYOK available**: Your API keys are encrypted at rest, never logged
- **[Read our Privacy Policy](https://synod.run/privacy)**: Our commitment to your data

### Beautiful CLI
- Real-time streaming with rich formatting
- Animated debate stages
- Interactive REPL mode

### Project Context (SYNOD.md)
Like Claude Code's CLAUDE.md, Synod reads project instructions from:
- `.synod/SYNOD.md` - Project-specific guidelines (commit to git)
- `.synod/SYNOD.local.md` - Local preferences (gitignored)
- `~/.synod/SYNOD.md` - User-wide preferences

```bash
synod> /init          # Create .synod/SYNOD.md
synod> /memory        # View loaded context
synod> /memory show   # Display full context
```

### Custom Slash Commands
Create reusable prompts as markdown files:

```bash
# Create .synod/commands/review.md
---
description: Run security review
---
Review this code for security vulnerabilities: $ARGUMENTS
```

Then use it: `synod> /review src/auth.py`

Supports `$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`, `$2` for argument interpolation.

### Git Integration
AI-powered git workflow:

```bash
synod> /diff          # Show git status and diff preview
synod> /commit        # Stage files, debate-generated commit message, push option
synod> /pr            # Create PR with debate-synthesized description (requires gh)
```

**How `/commit` works:**
1. Shows staged/unstaged files
2. Offers to stage all if nothing staged
3. Runs a debate to generate a conventional commit message
4. Shows message for confirmation
5. Creates commit and offers to push

**How `/pr` works:**
1. Gets commits and diff vs main/master
2. Runs a debate to generate PR title and description
3. Pushes branch and creates PR via GitHub CLI

### Adversarial Code Review
Run adversarial review on PRs, diffs, or files:

```bash
# CLI commands
synod review --pr 123   # Review PR #123 (requires gh)
synod review --diff     # Review uncommitted changes

# Interactive mode commands
synod> /review 123        # Review PR #123 (requires gh)
synod> /review file.py    # Review a specific file
synod> /critique a.py b.py  # Critique multiple files
```

**Requirements:**
- `/diff`, `/commit` - Just needs `git`
- `/pr`, `/review <pr-number>`, `synod review --pr` - Requires [GitHub CLI (gh)](https://cli.github.com)

### Hooks System

Automate workflows with hooks (like git hooks, but for AI). Hooks are shell commands that run at specific events.

```json
// .synod/hooks.json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "name": "run-tests-after-debate",
      "event": "post_debate",
      "command": "npm test 2>/dev/null || echo 'Tests skipped'"
    },
    {
      "name": "format-on-edit",
      "event": "file_modified",
      "command": "npx prettier --write \"$SYNOD_FILE\" 2>/dev/null"
    },
    {
      "name": "block-env-edits",
      "event": "pre_tool_use",
      "command": "if [[ \"$SYNOD_FILE\" =~ \\.env ]]; then echo '{\"allow\": false, \"message\": \"Cannot edit .env files\"}'; fi"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Hook Events

| Event | When it fires | Can block? | Use case |
|-------|--------------|------------|----------|
| `session_start` | Session begins | No | Setup, notifications |
| `session_end` | Session ends | No | Cleanup, reports |
| `pre_debate` | Before AI debate starts | Yes | Validation, preprocessing |
| `post_debate` | After AI debate completes | No | Tests, notifications |
| `pre_tool_use` | Before any tool executes | Yes | Block dangerous operations |
| `post_tool_use` | After any tool executes | No | Logging, side effects |
| `file_modified` | After a file is created/edited | No | Formatting, linting |

#### Environment Variables

Hooks receive context via environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Available in |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `SYNOD_EVENT` | The event type | All hooks |
| `SYNOD_WORKING_DIR` | Current working directory | All hooks |
| `SYNOD_QUERY` | User's query | `pre_debate`, `post_debate` |
| `SYNOD_TOOL` | Tool being executed | `*_tool_use` hooks |
| `SYNOD_TOOL_PARAMS` | JSON params for tool | `pre_tool_use` |
| `SYNOD_TOOL_RESULT` | Tool output (truncated) | `post_tool_use` |
| `SYNOD_FILE` | File being modified | `file_modified`, `*_tool_use` |

#### Blocking Hooks

`pre_tool_use` and `pre_debate` hooks can block execution by returning JSON:

```bash
# Block .env file edits
echo '{"allow": false, "message": "Cannot edit .env files"}'
```

#### Hook Commands

```bash
synod> /hooks                  # List configured hooks
synod> /hooks add <n> <event> <command>
synod> /hooks remove <n>
```

Hooks are loaded from both `~/.synod/hooks.json` (user-level) and `.synod/hooks.json` (project-level).

### Checkpoint/Undo System

Automatic checkpoints are created before every file modification, enabling undo:

```bash
synod> /rewind            # Show available checkpoints (last 10)
synod> /rewind <id>       # Restore specific checkpoint
```

Checkpoints are stored in `.synod/checkpoints/` (auto-gitignored) and retain the last 20 states.

## Pricing

| Tier | Price | Debates/Day | Bishops | Memory |

## Security

### Workspace Trust

When you run `synod` in a directory, you'll be asked to trust the workspace:

```
Accessing workspace: /path/to/project

Safety check: Is this a project you created or trust?
The Council will be able to read, edit, and execute files here.

? Yes, I trust this workspace
  No, exit
```

**Only trust workspaces you control.** Synod can read and modify files in trusted workspaces.

### Data Privacy Promise

**We never store your queries or code. Ever.**

| What | Stored? | Details |
|------|---------|---------|
| Your queries | ❌ No | Pass-through to AI providers only |
| Your code | ❌ No | Never touches our servers |
| Conversation content | ❌ No | Discarded after response |
| Raw text | ❌ No | Only semantic embeddings for memory |
| API keys (BYOK) | 🔒 Encrypted | AES-256 at rest, never logged |
| Usage metadata | ✓ Yes | Token counts, timestamps (for billing) |

**Memory stores insights, not content.** When Synod "remembers" that you prefer TypeScript, it stores a semantic embedding of that preference, not your actual code or conversation.

Read our full [Privacy Policy](https://synod.run/privacy) for details.

The CLI is a thin client. All debate orchestration happens in Synod Cloud.

## The Name

A **synod** (from Greek *σύνοδος*, "assembly") is a council convened to decide matters through structured debate. The Council of Nicaea in 325 AD brought together bishops from across the Roman Empire to debate and establish foundational doctrine.

We borrowed the model, not the religion:
- **Bishops**: Independent experts who propose and critique
- **Pope**: The neutral observer who synthesizes final judgment
- **Debate**: Adversarial discourse that stress-tests ideas

Ancient wisdom. Modern implementation.
